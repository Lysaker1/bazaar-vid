1. OpenAI Tools API Integration
The openaiToolsAPI.test.ts file validates your integration with OpenAI's function calling capabilities:
Tests proper parsing of tool calls from API responses
Handles multiple tool calls in a single response
Gracefully handles malformed responses and API errors
2. Response Streaming Performance
The responseStreaming.test.ts file ensures your streaming implementation meets performance targets:
Verifies <150ms initial response time
Confirms <500ms time-to-first-content
Tests throughput and degraded performance handling
Monitors stream event sequence accuracy
3. Dual-LLM Architecture
The dualLLMArchitecture.test.ts file validates your intent + code generation pipeline:
Tests coordination between intent detection and code generation models
Handles failures at each pipeline stage
Includes proper context sharing between models
4. Error Recovery
The errorRecovery.test.ts file tests your resilience to LLM service disruptions:
Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
Tests fallback to simpler models
Provides template-based final fallbacks
Handles non-retryable errors appropriately
5. Tool Definition Validation
The toolDefinitions.test.ts file ensures your OpenAI tool definitions follow best practices:
Validates against OpenAI's schema requirements
Checks for proper parameter types and documentation
Enforces required field annotations
6. Context Management
The contextManagement.test.ts file tests how you handle conversation context:
Maintains context across multiple requests
Implements smart context pruning when approaching token limits
Preserves critical context like project details
Manages multiple concurrent conversations
I've also set up the supporting infrastructure:
Jest configuration with proper test categorization
Environment variables setup
Mock implementations for OpenAI
Global test utilities and mocks
These tests provide comprehensive validation of your LLM integration, focusing on both functional correctness and performance characteristics.
