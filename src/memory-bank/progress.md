## Timeline Panel Enhancements - Phase 2 (Sprint 10)

Building on our previous timeline panel improvements, we've implemented several key enhancements to improve usability and synchronization:

### Playback Synchronization
- **Real-time Cursor Movement**: Enhanced the frame sync loop to ensure the timeline cursor moves in real-time with video playback
- **Loop Handling**: Added proper handling for video loops, ensuring the timeline cursor resets when video playback loops back to the beginning
- **Frame-accurate Tracking**: Implemented requestAnimationFrame-based tracking for smooth and accurate visualization of the current playback position

### Layout Improvements
- **Track Organization**: Added a fixed-width column (100px) on the left side of the timeline for displaying track names
- **Proper Grid Structure**: Separated the timeline grid from track names for cleaner scrolling behavior
- **Drag & Drop Improvements**: Fixed issues with sequence dragging to ensure proper track assignment and prevent item overlap

### Bug Fixes
- **Track Generation**: Resolved an issue where excessive tracks were being generated by properly calculating the maximum row number
- **Timeline Grid**: Improved the timeline grid layout to ensure consistent track heights and proper alignment
- **Dragging Behavior**: Fixed pointer event handling for smoother and more reliable drag operations

These improvements significantly enhance the timeline panel's usability, making it more reliable for video editing and sequencing tasks. The timeline now provides better visual feedback during playback and offers a more intuitive interface for managing video sequences.

## Timeline Panel Simplification (Sprint 11)

Based on user feedback, we've simplified the Timeline panel to improve stability and usability:

### Interface Streamlining
- **Unified Controls**: Consolidated zoom, delete, and copy controls into a single header bar
- **Improved Time Display**: Added clearer frame counter that shows current position in MM:SS:FF format
- **Direct Track Management**: Simplified the track system with an "Add Track" button directly in the track list

### Technical Improvements
- **Frame Sync Reliability**: Rewritten the frame synchronization logic to ensure more reliable playback tracking
- **Simpler Component Structure**: Removed dependency on complex sub-components (TimelineGrid, TimelineMarker) in favor of a more integrated approach
- **Type Safety**: Improved type checking to prevent undefined/null reference errors

### Visual Enhancements
- **Clearer Timeline Items**: Improved the visual appearance of timeline items with better contrast
- **Time Markers**: Added more visible time markers for easier navigation
- **Playhead Indicator**: Enhanced the playhead indicator with frame number display

These simplifications make the timeline component more maintainable and reliable, addressing the core functionality needs without unnecessary complexity.

## Console Error Fixes (Sprint 11)

We've addressed several console errors that were appearing during normal application usage:

### Chat Message Query Optimization
- **Improved Error Handling**: Added better error handling for chat.getMessages query to prevent console errors
- **Reduced Query Frequency**: Increased staleTime from 0 to 3000ms to reduce unnecessary API calls
- **Added Placeholder Data**: Ensured empty arrays are returned instead of errors when messages can't be fetched
- **Skip Batching**: Used TRPC context option to skip batching for this specific query

### Project Data Query Optimization
- **Reduced Polling Frequency**: Changed project.getById polling interval from 1000ms to 5000ms
- **Improved Data Freshness Management**: Added staleTime of 2000ms to reduce unnecessary network requests
- **Disabled Window Focus Refetching**: Prevented automatic refetching when window gets focus
- **Disabled Automatic Retries**: Turned off automatic request retries for failed requests

These changes significantly reduce console errors and network traffic while maintaining a responsive user experience. The application now makes fewer API calls and handles error cases more gracefully, resulting in a cleaner developer console and more efficient performance.

## Chat Stream Error Handling Improvements (Sprint 11)

We've enhanced the error handling for the chat streaming functionality to provide a more stable user experience:

### Improved Error Categorization
- **Network Error Detection**: Added specific handling for network-related errors with user-friendly messages
- **Timeout Handling**: Added specialized handling for timeout errors
- **Generic Error Fallback**: Implemented generic error messages for other error types

### Retry Mechanism
- **Automatic Retry Logic**: Implemented retry capability (up to 2 attempts) for recoverable errors
- **Exponential Backoff**: Added exponential backoff strategy with maximum delay of 5 seconds
- **State Recovery**: Added automatic message refetching after an error to ensure UI consistency

### Validation Improvements
- **Input Validation**: Added validation to prevent errors from invalid message IDs
- **Error Boundary**: Wrapped mutation calls in try/catch blocks for better exception handling
- **Improved Cancellation**: Enhanced the cancellation logic to properly clean up streaming resources

These improvements significantly reduce console errors during chat interactions and provide more helpful feedback to users when errors occur. The chat experience is now more robust against network issues and transient server errors.

## Homepage Redesign - Phase 2 (Sprint 11)

Building on our initial homepage redesign, we've implemented comprehensive enhancements to create a more engaging and professional landing experience:

### Visual Design Improvements
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Added subtle gradients to hero and CTA sections for visual depth
- **Typography Enhancements**: Increased heading sizes and applied text gradients for stronger visual hierarchy
- **Shadow Effects**: Added appropriate shadows to UI elements for depth and affordance
- **Interactive Elements**: Implemented hover effects on cards and buttons for better user feedback

### Structural Enhancements
- **Full-Width Sections**: Reorganized the page into clear, full-width content sections
- **Improved Spacing**: Increased padding and margins for better content breathing room
- **Visual Dividers**: Added decorative elements to separate and emphasize content
- **Consistent Grid Layout**: Refined the responsive grid system for better alignment across devices

### New Content Sections
- **Call to Action Area**: Added a dedicated CTA section to drive user engagement
- **Footer Component**: Implemented a proper footer with branding and copyright information
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Added scroll-to-top functionality for better navigation

These enhancements significantly improve the overall user experience and visual appeal of the landing page, giving the product a more premium and polished appearance. The design now follows modern web conventions with improved visual hierarchy, better use of whitespace, and clear pathways for user interaction.

## Timeline Interface Improvements (Sprint 11)

We've streamlined the timeline panel interface for better usability and terminology consistency:

### Visual Interface Enhancements
- **Consolidated Header Controls**: Moved all timeline controls into a single, well-organized header
- **Improved Layout Efficiency**: Removed the redundant controls row to create a cleaner, more streamlined interface
- **Enhanced Control Grouping**: Organized controls into logical groups with visual separators
- **Better Time Display**: Improved the visibility and readability of the current time indicator

### Terminology Standardization
- **Track â†’ Layer Rename**: Changed all instances of "Track" to "Layer" for better alignment with video editing terminology
- **Updated UI Text**: Renamed "Add Track" button to "Add Layer" for consistency
- **Component Naming**: Updated internal component variable naming to reflect the new terminology

### Visual Styling Improvements
- **Larger Control Buttons**: Increased button sizes for easier usability
- **Consistent Widths**: Aligned the layer column width across both header and timeline
- **Improved Spacing**: Enhanced spacing between controls for better visual separation
- **Monospaced Time Display**: Changed time display to use monospaced font for better readability

These changes improve the timeline panel's usability by reducing visual complexity and establishing more consistent terminology throughout the interface.

## UI Improvements

### Library Panel Redesign
- Transformed the "Projects" section into a more comprehensive "Library" interface
