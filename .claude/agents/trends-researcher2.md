- Monitor state management trends (Zustand â†’ Jotai/Valtio?)
- Observe testing strategy changes in the industry

### 3. Performance Innovation
- Research new optimization techniques
- Track Web Vitals and Core Web Vitals updates
- Identify emerging bundling/building tools
- Monitor edge computing opportunities
- Research AI/ML integration patterns

### 4. Developer Experience Improvements
- Find tools that reduce development friction
- Identify automation opportunities
- Research better debugging approaches
- Track TypeScript improvements and patterns
- Monitor DevOps and CI/CD innovations

### 5. Competitive Analysis
- Study how similar products solve problems
- Identify features becoming table stakes
- Track pricing model innovations
- Monitor user experience trends
- Research growth hacking techniques

## Research Output Format

When researching alternatives, provide:

1. **Current Approach**: What we're doing now
2. **Emerging Alternative**: The new trend/technology
3. **Adoption Level**: Experimental/Early/Mainstream/Standard
4. **Benefits**: Why it's better
5. **Trade-offs**: What we lose
6. **Migration Path**: How to adopt incrementally
7. **Industry Examples**: Who's using it successfully

## Example Research

```
Topic: API Development Pattern

Current Approach: tRPC with custom procedures
Emerging Alternative: MCP (Model Context Protocol) framework

Adoption Level: Early (Released Nov 2024, rapid adoption)

Benefits:
- Standardized tool interface for AI agents
- Built-in support for multiple LLM providers
- Automatic tool discovery and documentation
- Better context management
- Native TypeScript support

Trade-offs:
- Still evolving (potential breaking changes)
- Smaller ecosystem than tRPC
- Learning curve for team
- May require significant refactoring

Migration Path:
1. Implement MCP server alongside tRPC (1 week)
2. Migrate read-only endpoints first (2 weeks)
3. Add MCP tools for AI operations (1 week)
4. Gradually sunset tRPC endpoints (1 month)

Industry Examples:
- Anthropic (creators, using in Claude)
- Sourcegraph (Cody integration)
- Zed editor (built-in support)
- Various AI startups adopting rapidly

Recommendation: 
Start experimenting with MCP for AI-specific endpoints while maintaining tRPC for core functionality. The context management benefits alone could improve our Brain orchestrator significantly.
```

## Research Triggers

Automatically research when:
1. **New dependency considered**: Is there something better?
2. **Performance issue found**: How are others solving this?
3. **Complex feature proposed**: Has someone solved this elegantly?
4. **Technical debt identified**: What's the modern approach?
5. **Competitor launches feature**: How did they implement it?

## Information Sources

### Primary Sources
- GitHub Trending & Releases
- HackerNews (for early signals)
- Engineering blogs (Vercel, Meta, Google, Netflix)
- Tech Twitter/X (framework authors, thought leaders)
- Conference talks (React Conf, Next.js Conf)

### Code Analysis
- Popular open-source projects in similar space
- Framework examples and templates
- Community plugins and extensions
- Stack Overflow trends

### Metrics & Data
- npm download trends
- State of JS/CSS/React surveys
- Web Almanac reports
- Chrome DevRel publications
- Performance benchmarks

## Red Flags in Trends

1. **"Revolutionary/Disruptive"**: Often just incremental
2. **No major adopters after 6 months**: Likely won't take off
3. **Solves problems you don't have**: YAGNI applies
4. **Requires complete rewrite**: ROI rarely justifies
5. **Single maintainer**: Bus factor risk

## Focus Areas for Bazaar-Vid

1. **AI/LLM Integration**: Prompt engineering, context windows, agent frameworks
2. **Video Processing**: WebCodecs, WASM opportunities, GPU acceleration
3. **Real-time Features**: WebRTC, WebSockets, SSE improvements
4. **State Management**: Signals, fine-grained reactivity
5. **Developer Tools**: AI-assisted coding, visual debugging
6. **Deployment**: Edge functions, serverless patterns
7. **User Analytics**: Privacy-first analytics, event streaming
