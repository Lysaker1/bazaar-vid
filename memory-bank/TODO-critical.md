### 2. Fix Component Generation:
- [x] **Debug Missing TSX Code Error:**
  - [x] Added detailed logging to the build worker to diagnose why it thinks tsxCode is missing
  - [x] Updated database query in buildCustomComponent.ts to explicitly request the tsxCode column
  - [x] Implemented logging to track the data flow between component generation and build process
- [x] **Fix Animation Rendering:**
  - [x] Updated R2_PUBLIC_URL to correct Cloudflare R2 URL
  - [x] Implemented API proxy fallback for component loading
  - [x] Fixed component name validation to prevent esbuild errors
- [ ] **Implement Asset Storage:**
  - [ ] Verify asset R2 upload is working correctly
  - [ ] Ensure component code has correct access to assets 

## Resolved Issues

### ✅ Custom Component Build Race Condition (2025-05-10)

**Issue**: Component build worker was failing with "TSX code is missing for this job" error despite the code being properly generated.

**Root Cause**: Race condition where the build worker was attempting to build the component before the component generator had saved the TSX code to the database.

**Solution**:
- Modified `generateComponentCode.ts` to directly trigger `buildCustomComponent` after successfully saving TSX code
- Enhanced logging to better track the component generation and build process
- Added error handling for the dynamic import process
- Created tests to verify the direct build triggering works correctly

**Documentation**: See `memory-bank/sprints/sprint14/race-condition-fix.md` for detailed analysis and solution 

## Component Build Failures

### ✅ Fix Component Name Validation for esbuild
- Fixed an issue where component names starting with numbers (like "3dModelsSpinScene") would cause esbuild syntax errors
- Added `sanitizeComponentName` function that ensures component names are valid JavaScript identifiers:
  - Cannot start with a number (prefixes with "Scene" if it does)
  - Only contains valid characters (letters, numbers, $ and _)
  - Is never empty (defaults to "CustomScene")
- Applied to all places where component names are generated:
  - `componentGenerator.service.ts` (for components generated from ADBs)
  - `generateComponentCode.ts` (for components generated from LLM code)
  - `sceneAnalyzer.service.ts` (for component names from scene descriptions) 

### ✅ Fixed R2 Public URL for Component Loading (2025-05-14)
- Previous R2 URL had SSL/public access issues
- Enabled public access in Cloudflare R2 dashboard
- Updated environment variable to new URL: `https://pub-80969e2c6b73496db98ed52f98a48681.r2.dev`
- Added proxy fallback in API route for reliability
