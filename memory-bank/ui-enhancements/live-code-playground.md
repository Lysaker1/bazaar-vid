# UI Enhancement: Live Code Playground

## Summary
Added an interactive "Customize & Play" section to the homepage that allows users to edit line 130 of a Remotion component and see their changes come to life in real-time. This interactive playground demonstrates the product's capabilities while giving users a hands-on experience without requiring them to write code.

## Implementation Details

### Section Placement
- Positioned directly below the "React, Rendered." section
- Uses a light gray background (bg-gray-50) to distinguish it from the surrounding white sections
- Maintains the same max-width and padding as other homepage sections

### Left Side - Remotion Player
- Features a live Player component from `@remotion/player`
- Displays the `AnimatedTextInput` composition with user-editable text
- Key configuration:
  - `durationInFrames={180}` - 6 seconds at 30fps
  - `compositionWidth={1440}, compositionHeight={810}` - 16:9 aspect ratio
  - `autoPlay` and `loop` enabled, `controls` disabled for clean presentation
  - Remounts with a unique `key` when the user updates the text to restart the animation

### Right Side - Interactive Controls
- Features an input field for the user to type custom text
- Character counter shows current length and enforces 65-character limit
- "Update Animation" button that rerenders the Remotion player with the new text
- How-it-works instructions for users unfamiliar with the concept

### Remotion Components
- **AnimatedTextInput**: Main composition that accepts a `customText` prop
- **InputBox**: Visual component that displays the text with typing and cursor effects
- **GlowEffect**: Background animation with subtle pulsing gradient

### State Management
- `customAnimationText`: Stores the current text used in the Remotion animation
- `inputText`: Tracks what the user is typing in the input field
- `playgroundKey`: Forces remounting of the Player when text is updated

## Technical Implementation

### Key Interactive Functions
```jsx
// Handler to update the animation with new text
const handleUpdateAnimation = () => {
  if (inputText.length > 0 && inputText.length <= 65) {
    setCustomAnimationText(inputText);
    // Force remounting the component to refresh the animation
    setPlaygroundKey(prev => prev + 1);
  }
};
```

### Input Validation
```jsx
onChange={(e) => {
  // Limit to 65 characters
  if (e.target.value.length <= 65) {
    setInputText(e.target.value);
  }
}}
```

### Responsive Design
- Reverses column order on mobile (input field above the player)
- Uses grid for larger screens with 2-column layout
- Maintains aspect ratio of the player across screen sizes

## User Experience Enhancements
- Character counter provides instant feedback on input limitations
- Disabled button state prevents submission of empty or too-long text
- Instructions panel explains the functionality to new users
- Animation restarts automatically after text update for immediate feedback

## Files Modified
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Added the interactive section and associated components

## Visual Outcome
This section provides a hands-on demonstration of Bazaar's technology, allowing users to experiment directly with modifying animation text. It effectively showcases the power of Remotion while giving users an interactive taste of the platform's capabilities without requiring them to write code themselves.
