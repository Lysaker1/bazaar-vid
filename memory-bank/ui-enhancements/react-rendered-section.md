# UI Enhancement: "React, Rendered." Homepage Section

## Summary
Added a new section to the homepage titled "React, Rendered." that highlights Bazaar's use of React and Remotion for creating product demo videos from prompts. The section features a live Remotion Player that demonstrates code animation, reinforcing the product's capabilities.

## Implementation Details

### Section Placement
- Positioned between the "How it Works" and "Used by teams at" sections
- Maintains the same max-width and padding as other homepage sections

### Left Side Text Content
- Headline: "React, Rendered." using the same typography style as other section titles
- Subheading: "Bazaar turns prompts into product demo videos using React and Remotion"
- "Try it now" button that smoothly scrolls back to the input box when clicked

### Right Side Visual Element
- **Remotion Player Integration**:
  - Replaced static code editor visual with a live Remotion Player
  - Set to autoPlay, loop, and hide controls for a seamless demo experience
  - Player dimensions match the original placeholder visual
  - Maintains the rounded corners and shadow styling to match Bazaar's design language

### Remotion Animation Components
- **CodeDemoComposition**: Main composition that displays the typing animation
  - Dark background to match code editor aesthetic
  - Includes multiple lines of React/Remotion sample code
  - Set to run for 300 frames (10 seconds at 30fps)

- **CodeLine Component**: Creates animated typing effect for each line of code
  - Type-by-type animation with interpolated timing
  - Staggered appearance with configurable delays
  - Syntax highlighting using vibrant colors
  - Customizable indentation for code structure

### Visual Design
- Maintains Bazaar's brand aesthetics:
  - Rounded corners on the video container
  - Soft shadow and subtle background glow for depth
  - Consistent typography and color palette

### Interactive Element
- The "Try it now" button uses JavaScript to:
  - Focus the textarea at the top of the page
  - Smoothly scroll the user back to the input area
  - Creates a cohesive user journey through the page

## Files Modified
- `src/app/page.tsx`:
  - Added Remotion imports
  - Added CodeDemoComposition and CodeLine components
  - Replaced static code editor with Remotion Player

## Integration Notes
- Requires `@remotion/player` and `remotion` packages
- Animation is lightweight and doesn't significantly impact page load performance
- Enhances the page's interactivity with a live demonstration of the core technology

## Visual Outcome
The section now demonstrates Bazaar's capabilities through a live animation rather than a static mockup. The code typing effect visually reinforces the "React, Rendered." concept, showing users exactly what the product can do rather than just telling them.
