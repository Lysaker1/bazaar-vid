# Multi-Step Workflow Orchestration - Sprint 31

## 🚀 **Major Architectural Enhancement**

**Date**: 2025-01-25  
**Problem**: Brain Orchestrator could only execute ONE tool per request, failing on complex user operations  
**Solution**: Multi-step workflow orchestration with sequential tool execution

## 🎯 **User Problem Solved**

**Example Request**: *"take that chatting away from scene 2 and add it into a new scene. the transition between them should be by a mouse clicking on the 'start chatting' button"*

**Previous Behavior**: 
- Brain LLM would fail or only handle one part
- User had to make multiple separate requests
- Context was lost between operations

**New Behavior**:
- Brain LLM analyzes and plans multi-step workflow
- Executes editScene THEN addScene automatically
- Maintains context between steps
- Single request = complete workflow

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Enhanced Intent Analysis**
```typescript
interface WorkflowStep {
  toolName: string;
  context: string;
  dependencies?: string[];
}

// Brain LLM can now return either:
// 1. Single tool: { toolName: "addScene", reasoning: "..." }
// 2. Multi-step workflow: { workflow: [...], reasoning: "..." }
```

### **Workflow Execution Engine**
```typescript
async executeWorkflow(
  input: OrchestrationInput, 
  workflow: WorkflowStep[],
  reasoning?: string
): Promise<OrchestrationOutput>
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Sequential tool execution
- ✅ Inter-step context passing
- ✅ Combined chat responses
- ✅ Rollback on failures
- ✅ Detailed logging

### **Enhanced System Prompt**
Added complex request detection patterns:
- *"take X from scene Y and add it to a new scene"* → editScene + addScene
- *"remove Y from scene Z and create scene W with Z"* → editScene + addScene  
- *"delete scene A and merge its content with scene B"* → deleteScene + editScene

## 📊 **Example Workflow**

**User Request**: *"take chatting from scene 1 and add to new scene"*

**Brain LLM Analysis**:
```json
{
  "workflow": [
    {
      "toolName": "editScene",
      "context": "Remove chatting elements from existing scene",
      "dependencies": []
    },
    {
      "toolName": "addScene", 
      "context": "Create new scene with chatting elements and transition logic",
      "dependencies": ["step1_result"]
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Complex request requires editing existing scene then creating new scene"
}
```

**Execution Flow**:
1. **Step 1**: EditScene tool removes chatting from scene 1
2. **Step 2**: AddScene tool creates new scene with chatting + transition
3. **Result**: User gets exactly what they requested in one operation

## 🎁 **Benefits**

### **For Users**
- ✅ **Natural Requests**: Say what you want, system figures out the steps
- ✅ **Single Operations**: No need to break down complex requests
- ✅ **Context Preservation**: Steps understand previous results
- ✅ **Intelligent Planning**: Brain LLM creates optimal workflow

### **For System**
- ✅ **Architectural Scalability**: Can handle increasingly complex operations
- ✅ **Tool Reusability**: Existing tools work in workflows
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Sophisticated rollback and error recovery
- ✅ **Logging & Debugging**: Clear visibility into workflow execution

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Multi-Step Edits**
```bash
# Test: "move the button from scene 1 to scene 2"
# Expected: editScene (remove button) + editScene (add button)
```

### **Extract & Create**
```bash
# Test: "take the title animation and make it a separate intro scene"
# Expected: editScene (remove title) + addScene (create intro with title)
```

### **Merge Operations**
```bash
# Test: "combine the animations from scene 1 and scene 2 into one scene"
# Expected: editScene + editScene + addScene (or complex custom workflow)
```

## 🚨 **Current Limitations**

1. **Linear Workflows Only**: No parallel execution or branching
2. **Fixed Error Handling**: One step fails = entire workflow fails
3. **Limited Dependencies**: Basic step dependency tracking
4. **Context Passing**: Simple object passing between steps

## 🛣️ **Future Enhancements**

### **Phase 1 Improvements**
- Parallel step execution for independent operations
- Advanced dependency management
- Partial rollback (revert specific steps)
- Workflow templates for common patterns

### **Phase 2 Advanced Features**
- Conditional workflows (if/then logic)
- User approval checkpoints in workflows
- Workflow visualization and editing
- Custom workflow creation interface

## 📈 **Success Metrics**

### **Expected Improvements**
- **Complex Request Success Rate**: 0% → 85%+
- **User Request Breakdown Reduction**: 80% fewer multi-message workflows
- **Context Preservation**: Near-perfect step-to-step context passing
- **System Intelligence**: Dramatically improved user experience

### **Monitoring Points**
- Workflow success/failure rates
- Average workflow length
- Most common workflow patterns
- User satisfaction with complex operations

## 🎉 **Impact Assessment**

This enhancement fundamentally changes how users interact with the system. Instead of being limited to single operations, users can now express complex creative workflows naturally, and the system intelligently breaks them down into optimal tool sequences.

**Strategic Value**: This positions Bazaar as a truly intelligent creative assistant, not just a single-operation tool generator.

**User Experience**: Users can focus on creative intent rather than technical implementation details.

**Architecture**: Sets foundation for increasingly sophisticated workflow automation and AI-driven creative assistance.
