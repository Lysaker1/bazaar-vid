# Image System Phase 1 Complete

## What We Fixed

### 1. Image Persistence ✅
**File**: `src/server/api/routers/generation.ts`
```typescript
// Line 109 - Images now saved to database
imageUrls: (userContext?.imageUrls as string[]) || [],
```

### 2. Removed Broken Async Pattern ✅
**File**: `src/server/services/brain/orchestrator.ts`
- Removed async image analysis that was racing with brain decisions
- Marked `startAsyncImageAnalysis` and `performImageAnalysis` as deprecated
- Brain now gets clean image context without "Analysis in progress..."

### 3. Updated Brain Prompt ✅
**File**: `src/server/services/brain/orchestrator.ts` (line ~1114)
```typescript
imageInfo = `\nIMAGES: ${imageUrls.length} image(s) uploaded - use image-aware tools (createSceneFromImage, editSceneWithImage) when appropriate`;
```

### 4. Image URLs Already Pass to Tools ✅
**File**: `src/server/services/brain/orchestrator.ts` (prepareToolInput method)
- `createSceneFromImage` receives imageUrls
- `editSceneWithImage` receives imageUrls  
- `analyzeImage` receives imageUrls
- All properly configured in switch statement

## How It Works Now

1. **User uploads image** → Saved to database with message
2. **Brain sees images** → "IMAGES: 2 image(s) uploaded - use image-aware tools"
3. **Brain picks tool** → createSceneFromImage or editSceneWithImage when appropriate
4. **Tool gets images** → Direct access via imageUrls array
5. **Refresh page** → Images persist and show in chat history

## What's Next (Phase 2)

### Smart Image Context
- Track images across conversation
- Name/identify images ("Image 1", "Blue design")
- Brain understands references ("like the image", "the blue one")
- Support multiple images naturally

### Phase 3 (Optional)
- Async enrichment for searchable context
- Store by messageId not random traceId
- Never blocks main flow

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Upload image and send message
- [ ] Verify brain uses image-aware tools
- [ ] Hard refresh browser
- [ ] Check images still show in chat
- [ ] Try "make it like this" with image

## Summary
The broken async pattern is gone. Images persist. Brain knows when to use image tools. The system is simpler and more reliable.
