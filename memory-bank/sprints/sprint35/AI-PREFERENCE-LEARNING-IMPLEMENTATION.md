# AI-Powered Preference Learning Implementation

## What Was Done

### 1. Integrated AI Preference Extractor âœ…
The `preferenceExtractor.service.ts` is now properly integrated into the `contextBuilder.service.ts`.

### 2. Async Learning Pattern âœ…
Preference learning now runs **asynchronously** after the main context is built:
- No performance impact on main request
- Learns from user patterns in the background
- Stores high-confidence preferences automatically

### 3. How It Works

#### Immediate Response (No Delay)
```typescript
// 1. Build context with existing preferences
const context = await buildContext(...);

// 2. Return immediately to user
return context;

// 3. Learn preferences in background (fire-and-forget)
triggerAsyncPreferenceLearning(...).catch(console.error);
```

#### Smart Triggering
Only triggers AI learning when:
- User provides a message (not just loading)
- Project has 2+ scenes (enough context)
- Conversation has meaningful content

#### What Gets Analyzed
```typescript
// AI analyzes:
- Conversation history
- Current request  
- Scene patterns (types, elements, styles)
- Existing preferences
```

## Performance Impact: ZERO

1. **Main Request**: Unaffected - returns immediately
2. **Background Learning**: Uses fast GPT-4o-mini
3. **Caching**: Results stored in ProjectMemoryService

## How Preferences Are Used

### First Request (No Preferences Yet)
```
User: "Create a scene with smooth animations"
â†’ Scene created with smooth animations
â†’ Background: AI learns user prefers smooth animations
```

### Second Request (Preferences Loaded)
```
User: "Add another scene"
â†’ Context includes: animation_style = "smooth" (0.85 confidence)
â†’ New scene automatically uses smooth animations
```

### Smart Override Detection
```
User: "Make this one with bouncy animations" 
â†’ Scene created with bouncy animations
â†’ AI understands: One-time override, not preference change
â†’ Preference remains: animation_style = "smooth"
```

## What's Deprecated

The basic `quickExtractPreferences` method is now deprecated:
- Still runs for immediate keyword detection
- Real learning happens via AI in background
- Will be fully removed in future sprint

## Testing the Implementation

1. Create a project and add 2-3 scenes
2. Use consistent style language ("I prefer minimal designs")
3. Check console logs for:
   ```
   [ContextBuilder-Optimized] ðŸ§  Starting async preference learning...
   [PreferenceExtractor] ðŸ§  Learned: style_preference = minimal_modern (0.85 confidence)
   ```
4. Create another scene - should automatically use learned preferences

## Next Steps

1. Add conversation history tracking (currently simplified)
2. Implement preference confidence decay over time
3. Add user UI to view/edit learned preferences
4. Remove deprecated quickExtractPreferences completely
