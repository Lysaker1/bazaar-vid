# ShipScore Leaderboard (opt‑in)

## Concept
- Rank teams by shipped updates (merged PRs with attached video) over trailing 30 days. Links to PR + video.

## Anti‑gaming
- Weight unique files touched and end‑user impact keywords.
- Cap daily points; decay older shipments.
- Require valid video + PR link to count.

## Monetization
- Free public board; Pro profile ($9–$29/mo) with badge, banner, pinned updates.
- Sponsor categories carefully; org‑only private dashboards bundled in Business.

## Privacy
- Opt‑in only; private repos excluded unless explicitly allowed.
