# Adjacent Tools & Positioning (quick)

## Changelog platforms (text‑first)
- Beamer, Headway, LaunchNotes, Canny, AnnounceKit, Changelogfy, etc. Great pages/widgets; no PR→video automation.

## GitHub native
- Auto‑generated release notes exist, but text‑only.

## Our wedge
- On‑brand motion graphics from PRs, zero friction. Publish to PR + public changelog + embeds. Potential public leaderboard.
