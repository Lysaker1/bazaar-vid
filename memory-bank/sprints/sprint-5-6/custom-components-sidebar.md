# Custom Components Sidebar Implementation

## Feature Overview

The Custom Components Sidebar has been fully implemented, providing users with a comprehensive way to manage and utilize their generated Remotion components. This feature allows users to:

1. View all their custom components across all projects
2. See real-time component status (pending, building, ready, error)
3. Insert ready components directly into their video timeline
4. Instantly preview the components in the video player

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend Changes

#### New tRPC Endpoints
- Added `listAllForUser` endpoint to `customComponentRouter` that joins projects and component jobs tables
- Created type-safe query to fetch all components owned by the current user

#### Component Post-Processing
- Added automatic import fixing for generated Remotion components
- Ensures code is ready-to-use without missing dependencies

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Sidebar UI
- Created `CustomComponentsSidebar` section in the main sidebar
- Implemented collapsible design matching the existing UI patterns
- Added status indicators using `CustomComponentStatus` component

#### Timeline Integration
- Implemented component insertion using the project's Zustand state management pattern
- Used JSON patch operations to add components as custom scenes
- Maintained UI reactivity to show immediate updates in the Preview panel

## Technical Architecture

The implementation follows the application's core architecture principles:

- **Full-Stack Type Safety**: All database queries and UI components use TypeScript
- **State Management Consistency**: Uses existing `videoState` Zustand store for state updates
- **Server/Client Separation**: Clear separation between API endpoints and UI components

## Testing Notes

The feature has been tested for:
- Component generation and display across multiple projects
- Status indicator accuracy and updates
- Timeline insertion and preview updating
- Various edge cases (empty states, error handling)

## Future Improvements

- Add timeline drag-and-drop positioning for components
- Allow component duration adjustment
- Add preview functionality before insertion
- Support component parameters customization
