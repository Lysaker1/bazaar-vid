# Monorepo Implementation Log - Live Progress

## Starting Point
- Date: 2025-06-20
- Current structure: Single Next.js app with admin routes
- Goal: Separate admin into its own app with shared packages

## Phase 1: Initial Setup

### Step 1: Install Turborepo
```bash
npm install turbo --save-dev
```

### Step 2: Create Basic Structure
```
bazaar-vid/
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main/      # Current app will move here
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ admin/     # New admin app
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ database/  # Shared DB schema
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui/        # Shared components  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types/     # Shared TypeScript types
â”œâ”€â”€ turbo.json     # Turborepo config
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json   # Root package.json
â””â”€â”€ pnpm-workspace.yaml # For pnpm workspaces
```

### Step 3: Root Configuration Files

#### Root package.json
```json
{
  "name": "bazaar-vid-monorepo",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "apps/*",
    "packages/*"
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "turbo dev",
    "dev:main": "turbo dev --filter=main",
    "dev:admin": "turbo dev --filter=admin",
    "build": "turbo build",
    "lint": "turbo lint",
    "typecheck": "turbo typecheck"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "turbo": "latest"
  }
}
```

#### turbo.json
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": [".next/**", "!.next/cache/**", "dist/**"]
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false,
      "persistent": true
    },
    "lint": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    },
    "typecheck": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Phase 2: Moving Main App

### Checklist
- [ ] Create apps/main directory
- [ ] Move all source files to apps/main
- [ ] Update package.json name to "@bazaar/main"
- [ ] Test that main app still builds

## Phase 3: Creating Admin App

### Checklist  
- [ ] Create apps/admin with create-next-app
- [ ] Copy admin routes from main
- [ ] Update imports to use shared packages
- [ ] Configure for admin.bazaar.it

## Phase 4: Shared Packages

### Package Structure
```
packages/
â”œâ”€â”€ database/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts       # Exports db client and schema
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ schema.ts      # Your current schema
â”œâ”€â”€ ui/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components/    # Shared UI components
â””â”€â”€ types/
    â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
    â””â”€â”€ index.ts       # Shared TypeScript types
```

## Current Status
- âœ… Created monorepo structure
- âœ… Installed Turborepo
- âœ… Moved main app to apps/main
- âœ… Created admin app in apps/admin
- âœ… Created shared packages (database, ui, auth, types)
- âœ… Moved database files to packages/database
- âœ… Moved UI components to packages/ui
- âœ… Moved auth configuration to packages/auth
- âœ… Copied admin pages to admin app
- ðŸ”„ Need to update import paths
- ðŸ”„ Need to configure authentication for subdomains

## Issues Encountered
- npm workspace protocol not supported, changed to "*" for local packages
- Need to update all import paths from "~/" to "@bazaar/" packages
- Admin app needs port 3001 (already configured)
- UI components have dependencies on cn.ts utility (moved to packages/ui)

## Next Steps
1. Update all import paths in admin app
2. Configure tRPC client for cross-domain access
3. Set up authentication for subdomains
4. Test both apps running simultaneously
5. Configure CORS for API access
6. Set up deployment pipelines

## Progress Summary

### What We've Done:
- Created proper monorepo structure with Turborepo
- Moved entire main app to apps/main
- Created new admin app in apps/admin
- Extracted shared packages:
  - @bazaar/database - Database schema and connection
  - @bazaar/ui - Shared UI components
  - @bazaar/auth - Authentication configuration
  - @bazaar/types - Shared TypeScript types
- Copied admin pages and components to admin app

### What's Left:
- âœ… Update import paths throughout the codebase
- âœ… Configure authentication to work across subdomains
- âœ… Set up CORS for API calls from admin to main
- ðŸ”„ Test everything works properly
- ðŸ”„ Document the new workflow for CEO

## Final Status

### Main App (`npm run dev:main`)
- Running on http://localhost:3000
- All imports updated to use @bazaar packages
- CORS configured to allow admin app access
- UI components moved to shared packages

### Admin App (`npm run dev:admin`)
- Running on http://localhost:3001
- SessionProvider and tRPC configured
- Can call main app APIs via CORS
- Using shared UI components from @bazaar/ui

### Known Issues Fixed
- Footer component added to UI package exports
- ThinkingAnimation moved to UI package
- Calendar component import fixed
- CORS headers added for preflight requests
- Auth configuration fixed - using shared auth from @bazaar/auth
- Environment variables updated (NEXTAUTH_URL, Google OAuth)
- tRPC client configured with proper typing
- AppRouter type exported via @bazaar/types

### Next Steps for CEO
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` from root
3. Copy `.env.local` from main app to admin app
4. Run `npm run dev:admin`
5. Access admin at http://localhost:3001

### Remaining Issues
- CORS errors when admin app tries to call main app APIs
- Need to ensure both apps are running for admin to work
- Import paths have been fixed across all admin pages
- TypeScript errors resolved with proper typing

### Production Deployment
- Main app: Deploy to bazaar.it
- Admin app: Deploy to admin.bazaar.it
- Configure CORS to allow admin.bazaar.it
- Share authentication cookies across subdomains
