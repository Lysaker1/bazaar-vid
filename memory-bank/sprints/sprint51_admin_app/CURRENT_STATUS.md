# Monorepo Implementation - Current Status

## What We've Accomplished So Far

### âœ… Monorepo Structure Created
```
bazaar-vid/
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main/         # Your main app (moved from root)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ admin/        # New admin app for CEO
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ database/     # Shared database schema
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui/           # Shared UI components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth/         # Shared authentication
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types/        # Shared TypeScript types
â””â”€â”€ turbo.json        # Turborepo configuration
```

### âœ… Main App Moved
- All your code is now in `apps/main/`
- Package name changed to `@bazaar/main`
- Everything preserved, just relocated

### âœ… Admin App Created
- Fresh Next.js app in `apps/admin/`
- Package name: `@bazaar/admin`
- Configured to run on port 3001
- Admin pages copied from main app

### âœ… Shared Packages Extracted
1. **@bazaar/database**
   - Database connection logic
   - All schema files
   - Drizzle configuration

2. **@bazaar/ui**
   - All UI components (button, card, etc.)
   - cn utility function
   - Ready to share between apps

3. **@bazaar/auth**
   - NextAuth configuration
   - Session management
   - Ready for subdomain configuration

4. **@bazaar/types**
   - Structure created for shared types
   - Ready for type definitions

## What Still Needs to Be Done

### ðŸ”„ Import Path Updates
All imports need to change from:
```typescript
import { Button } from "~/components/ui/button"
```
To:
```typescript
import { Button } from "@bazaar/ui"
```

### ðŸ”„ Authentication Configuration
Need to update auth to work across subdomains:
```typescript
// In auth config
domain: '.bazaar.it' // Note the dot!
```

### ðŸ”„ API Access Setup
Admin app needs to access main app APIs:
- Configure CORS headers
- Set up tRPC client
- Handle cross-domain requests

### ðŸ”„ Testing
- Run both apps simultaneously
- Verify admin can access data
- Test authentication flow

## Current File Locations

### Your Files (Main App)
- Code: `/apps/main/src/`
- Config: `/apps/main/next.config.js`
- Pages: `/apps/main/src/app/`

### CEO's Files (Admin App)
- Code: `/apps/admin/`
- Admin pages: `/apps/admin/app/`
- Components: `/apps/admin/components/`

### Shared Resources
- Database: `/packages/database/`
- UI Components: `/packages/ui/`
- Auth: `/packages/auth/`

## Commands to Remember

```bash
# Run main app (your app)
npm run dev:main

# Run admin app (CEO's app)
npm run dev:admin

# Run both apps
npm run dev

# Build everything
npm run build
```

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Update import paths in admin app files
2. Configure authentication for subdomains
3. Test running both apps
4. Set up API communication

The structure is in place, now we need to wire everything together!
