# A2A UI Integration - Sprint 22

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of integrating the A2A backend with the user interface to provide real-time visualization of agent activities, message exchanges, and status updates in the evaluation dashboard.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. SSE Event System Enhancement
- ✅ Added new `AgentCommunication` event type to the SSE manager
- ✅ Updated the SSE event type definitions in both the backend and frontend
- ✅ Created proper type conversion between internal and client-facing SSE event types

### 2. Message Bus Integration
- ✅ Enhanced the Message Bus to emit agent communication events via SSE
- ✅ Created a utility function to convert between internal and client event formats
- ✅ Updated the `publish` method to emit agent communication events for visualization
- ✅ Added proper type safety to prevent type mismatches between different SSE event definitions

### 3. Frontend Components
- ✅ Updated the `useSSE` hook to handle agent communication events
- ✅ Enhanced the `AgentNetworkGraph` component to visualize agent communications
- ✅ Added automatic status transitions for agents based on message activity
- ✅ Implemented visual feedback for message passing between agents

## Current Implementation Details

### Agent Communication Visualization
- When agents exchange messages, the Message Bus now publishes an `AgentCommunication` event
- The UI subscribes to these events and updates the agent network graph in real-time
- Agent status is updated to show when they're sending/receiving messages
- After a brief period (3 seconds), agents return to idle status if no other events are received
- Message history is maintained and displayed in the UI

### Type Safety
- Created and maintained consistent type definitions between backend and frontend
- Implemented proper conversion between internal and client-facing event formats
- Added explicit type annotations to prevent TypeScript errors

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Verify the functionality with real agent communication in a complete task flow
2. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor SSE connection stability during high message volume
3. **UI Polish**: Enhance the visualization with better animations and transitions
4. **Documentation**: Update the A2A implementation guide with new event types

## Technical Integration Points

- **Message Bus** → **SSE Manager** → **Frontend UI Components**
- Message flow: Agent sends message → Message Bus publishes event → SSE stream updates → UI visualizes changes

## Open Questions / Future Work

- Consider adding filtering options for different types of agent communications
- Explore adding a replay feature to visualize past task executions
- Investigate performance improvements for large-scale agent networks
