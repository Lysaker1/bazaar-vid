# Sprint 82: Audio Support Feature

## Sprint Overview
**Sprint Number**: 82  
**Sprint Name**: Audio Support  
**Start Date**: 2025-07-21  
**Status**: COMPLETED âœ…  
**Primary Goal**: Enable users to upload and manage background audio for their videos

## Problem Statement
Users had no way to add background music or audio to their videos. All videos were silent, limiting their professional appeal and engagement potential.

## Solution Implemented
Created a complete audio management system with:
- Audio file upload support (MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG, AAC)
- Audio trimming interface
- Volume control
- Integration with video preview and export

## Key Achievements

### 1. Audio Panel
- New dedicated panel in the workspace for audio management
- Clean, intuitive interface following existing panel patterns
- Accessible via sidebar with Music icon

### 2. Upload Infrastructure
- Extended media upload system to support audio files
- 50MB file size limit for audio
- Stores audio files in Cloudflare R2 under `/audio/` path
- Supports common audio formats

### 3. Audio Controls
- **Trimming**: Start and end time selection with sliders
- **Volume**: 0-100% volume adjustment
- **Preview**: Play button with progress indicator
- **Loop**: Audio loops within trimmed range during preview

### 4. Video Integration
- Audio automatically plays with video preview
- Uses Remotion's `<Audio>` component
- Supports both single and multi-scene compositions
- Audio included in final video export

## Technical Implementation

### Components Modified/Created
1. **AudioPanel.tsx** (NEW)
   - Complete audio management interface
   - Handles upload, trim, volume, and playback

2. **MediaUpload.tsx** (RENAMED from ImageUpload.tsx)
   - Extended to support audio file uploads
   - Shows audio files with music icon

3. **PreviewPanelG.tsx**
   - Added audio support to video compositions
   - Audio data passed via `window.projectAudio`
   - Re-compiles when audio changes

4. **Video State Store**
   - Added `AudioTrack` interface
   - Added `updateProjectAudio` method
   - Audio persists per project

5. **Upload API Route**
   - Extended validation for audio MIME types
   - Supports audio file uploads to R2

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Simple Overlay Approach**: Audio is a background overlay, not integrated into AI prompts
2. **Manual Control**: Users have full control, no AI automation
3. **Project-Level Audio**: One audio track per project (replaceable)
4. **Automatic Features**: Looping for short audio, frame conversion

## User Experience Flow
1. User clicks Audio panel in sidebar
2. Clicks "Upload Audio" button
3. Selects MP3 file from computer
4. Audio loads with waveform placeholder
5. User adjusts trim points if needed
6. User adjusts volume if needed
7. Audio plays automatically in preview
8. Audio included in video export

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Audio Panel Not Displaying
**Problem**: Panel was blank when opened  
**Root Cause**: Missing case in `renderPanelContent` switch statement  
**Solution**: Added `case 'audio'` to render AudioPanel component

### Issue 2: MP3 Files Grayed Out in File Picker
**Problem**: macOS file picker showing MP3s as unselectable  
**Solution**: Added explicit file extensions to accept attribute: `accept="audio/*,.mp3,.m4a,.wav,.ogg,.aac"`

## Performance Considerations
- Audio files cached in browser after upload
- Trim/volume changes don't require re-upload
- Preview compilation only triggered on audio URL/settings change
- File size limit prevents performance issues

## Future Enhancement Opportunities
1. Multiple audio tracks support
2. Fade in/out controls
3. Audio waveform visualization
4. Sound effects library
5. AI-aware audio (music that matches video mood)
6. Audio timing sync with scene transitions

## Metrics & Impact
- Feature enables professional video creation
- Addresses common user request
- Simple implementation reduces support burden
- No impact on existing features

## Lessons Learned
1. Always check component rendering pipeline when panels don't display
2. File picker accept attribute benefits from explicit extensions
3. Simple overlay approach often better than complex integration
4. Manual controls give users more satisfaction than automation

## Dependencies
- Remotion Audio component
- Cloudflare R2 for storage
- HTML5 Audio API for preview
- Zustand for state management

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Audio upload works for all supported formats
- [x] Trim controls update audio playback
- [x] Volume control affects playback
- [x] Audio persists on page refresh
- [x] Audio plays in video preview
- [x] Audio included in export
- [x] File size validation works
- [x] Invalid file type rejection works

## Code Quality
- Follows existing panel patterns
- Proper error handling
- User feedback via toasts
- Debug logging for troubleshooting
- Clean component separation

## Sprint Retrospective
**What Went Well**:
- Clean implementation following existing patterns
- Quick identification and fix of rendering issue
- Good user experience with intuitive controls

**What Could Be Improved**:
- Could have caught the render switch issue earlier
- Waveform visualization would enhance UX

**Overall**: Successful sprint delivering core audio functionality users need.
