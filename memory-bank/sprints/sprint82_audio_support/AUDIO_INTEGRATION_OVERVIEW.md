# Sprint 82: Audio Support & Integration

**Sprint Start Date:** July 22, 2025  
**Sprint Lead:** Markus  
**Status:** PLANNING

## Overview

Sprint 82 focuses on elevating Bazaar-Vid's audio capabilities to enable professional-grade audiovisual synchronization. The goal is to transform our current manual alignment approach into an intelligent, data-driven system that automatically synchronizes visual elements with musical events.

## Business Value

- **Increased Engagement**: Videos synchronized to music show 35-40% higher viewer retention
- **Reduced Production Time**: Automated beat synchronization saves 10-15 minutes per video
- **Professional Quality**: Matches output quality of dedicated motion graphics software
- **Competitive Advantage**: First AI video platform with intelligent audio-reactive capabilities

## Core Objectives

### 1. Waveform Visualization
Implement a performant, real-time audio waveform display within the Remotion timeline to provide visual feedback for timing decisions.

### 2. Beat Detection & Analysis
Deploy sophisticated DSP algorithms to extract beat positions, tempo, and musical structure from uploaded audio files.

### 3. Audio-Reactive Scene Generation
Enable the AI to generate scenes that dynamically respond to musical events, creating synchronized visual experiences.

### 4. Frame-Perfect Synchronization
Ensure all visual transitions align precisely with the 30fps video timeline while maintaining musical timing accuracy.

## Technical Requirements

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- [ ] Research Remotion audio visualization components
- [ ] Implement basic waveform renderer
- [ ] Create audio file upload and storage pipeline
- [ ] Design beat detection service architecture

### Phase 2: Beat Detection (Week 2)
- [ ] Implement spectral flux beat detection algorithm
- [ ] Add onset strength analysis for transient detection
- [ ] Create JSON timeline format for beat maps
- [ ] Build caching system for processed audio

### Phase 3: Integration (Week 3)
- [ ] Connect beat detection to scene generation
- [ ] Update AI prompts for audio-aware generation
- [ ] Implement audio-reactive scene mutations
- [ ] Add user controls for sensitivity adjustment

### Phase 4: Polish (Week 4)
- [ ] Performance optimization (target <40ms overhead)
- [ ] Cross-genre testing and tuning
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms for edge cases
- [ ] Documentation and examples

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Beat Detection Accuracy | ≥85% F-Score | Automated testing suite |
| Render Performance | ≤40ms overhead | Performance profiler |
| User Satisfaction | +15% NPS | Post-launch survey |
| Generation Quality | 90% sync accuracy | Manual QA review |

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Performance Impact**: Mitigate with GPU acceleration and caching
- **Cross-Genre Accuracy**: Use ensemble of algorithms with genre detection
- **Browser Compatibility**: Implement WebAudio API fallbacks

### User Experience Risks
- **Complexity**: Hide advanced controls behind "Pro" toggle
- **Learning Curve**: Provide templates and examples
- **Expectations**: Clear communication about capabilities

## Dependencies

- Remotion audio API documentation
- WebAudio API for browser compatibility
- Cloud storage for audio files (R2)
- GPU resources for waveform rendering

## Key Decisions

1. **DSP vs AI**: Use traditional DSP for beat detection (more reliable) with AI for creative decisions
2. **Real-time vs Preprocessed**: Preprocess audio on upload for better performance
3. **User Control Level**: Provide simple presets with advanced manual controls
4. **Storage Strategy**: Cache beat maps in database, audio files in R2

## Next Steps

1. Review Remotion audio documentation
2. Prototype waveform visualization component
3. Research open-source beat detection libraries
4. Design database schema for audio metadata
5. Create API endpoints for audio processing
