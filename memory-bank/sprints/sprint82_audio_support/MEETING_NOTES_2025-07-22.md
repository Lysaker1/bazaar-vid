# Meeting Notes: Audio Integration Planning Session

**Date:** July 22, 2025  
**Time:** 20:41 CEST  
**Attendees:** Markus  
**Topic:** Sprint 82 - Advanced Audio Support

## Meeting Summary

Markus outlined the vision for advancing Bazaar-Vid's audio capabilities, emphasizing the need for sophisticated audio-visual synchronization that goes beyond manual timing adjustments.

## Key Discussion Points

### 1. Waveform Visualization
- **Requirement**: Display audio waveform directly in the Remotion timeline
- **Purpose**: Provide visual reference for timing decisions
- **Technical Approach**: Follow Remotion's official documentation for audio components
- **Performance Goal**: Real-time rendering without impacting editor responsiveness

### 2. Beat-Synchronized Video Generation
- **Vision**: Videos that automatically adjust to audio drops and beats
- **Implementation**: AI should understand musical structure and timing
- **User Experience**: Zero manual intervention required for basic sync
- **Advanced Users**: Provide manual adjustment tools for fine-tuning

### 3. AI Audio Analysis
- **Question Raised**: "How can AI agents interpret audio files to identify beats?"
- **Proposed Solution**: Combination of DSP algorithms and ML models
- **Technical Challenge**: Frame-accurate synchronization with 30fps video
- **Research Direction**: Investigate existing beat detection libraries and Remotion integrations

## Action Items

1. **Research Phase** (Immediate)
   - [ ] Study Remotion's audio API documentation
   - [ ] Investigate Web Audio API capabilities
   - [ ] Research open-source beat detection algorithms
   - [ ] Explore AI models for music analysis

2. **Prototype Development** (Week 1)
   - [ ] Create basic waveform visualization component
   - [ ] Implement simple beat detection algorithm
   - [ ] Test integration with existing preview system

3. **Architecture Design** (Week 1-2)
   - [ ] Design audio processing pipeline
   - [ ] Plan database schema for audio metadata
   - [ ] Create API endpoints for audio upload/analysis

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Prioritize Remotion Compatibility**: All audio features must work seamlessly with Remotion's rendering pipeline
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic features and add complexity incrementally
3. **Performance First**: Audio processing should not degrade the user experience

## Open Questions for Research

1. **Beat Detection Accuracy**: What level of accuracy can we achieve across different music genres?
2. **Real-time vs Preprocessing**: Should we analyze audio in real-time or during upload?
3. **Storage Strategy**: How do we efficiently store and cache audio analysis data?
4. **User Controls**: What level of control should we expose to users without overwhelming them?

## Success Criteria

- Waveform visualization loads within 1 second
- Beat detection achieves >85% accuracy on popular music
- Scene transitions align with beats without manual adjustment
- System handles various audio formats (MP3, WAV, AAC)
- Performance overhead stays below 40ms

## Next Steps

1. Create technical architecture document (COMPLETED)
2. Set up development environment for audio processing
3. Begin prototype of waveform component
4. Schedule follow-up meeting for progress review

## Notes

- Markus emphasized the importance of following established patterns rather than inventing new solutions
- The goal is to match or exceed the audio sync capabilities of professional video editing software
- This feature could be a major differentiator for Bazaar-Vid in the AI video generation space
