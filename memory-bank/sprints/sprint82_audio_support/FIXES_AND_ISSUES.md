# Sprint 82: Fixes and Issues Log

## Issue #1: Audio Panel Not Displaying

### Problem Description
When clicking the Audio icon in the sidebar, the panel would open but show completely blank/white content.

### Symptoms
- Audio panel tab appeared in workspace
- Panel content was empty white space
- No error messages in console
- Panel was non-functional

### Root Cause
The `renderPanelContent` function in `WorkspaceContentAreaG.tsx` was missing a case for the 'audio' panel type. The switch statement didn't include audio, so it returned null.

### Solution
Added the missing case to the switch statement:
```typescript
case 'audio':
  return <AudioPanel 
    projectId={projectId} 
  />;
```

### Files Modified
- `/src/app/projects/[id]/generate/workspace/WorkspaceContentAreaG.tsx`

### Lessons Learned
- Always check the render pipeline when components don't display
- Verify all switch statements include new cases
- Test panel rendering immediately after adding to sidebar

## Issue #2: MP3 Files Grayed Out in File Picker

### Problem Description
When trying to upload MP3 files, the macOS file picker showed them as grayed out/unselectable.

### Symptoms
- Upload button opened file picker correctly
- MP3 files visible but not selectable
- Other file types might be selectable
- Affected all audio formats

### Root Cause
The file input accept attribute `accept="audio/*"` wasn't specific enough for some browsers/OS combinations.

### Solution
Made the accept attribute more explicit by adding specific file extensions:
```typescript
accept="audio/*,.mp3,.m4a,.wav,.ogg,.aac"
```

Also added fallback validation based on file extensions in the handler.

### Files Modified
- `/src/app/projects/[id]/generate/workspace/panels/AudioPanel.tsx`

### Additional Fixes
- Added file extension validation as fallback
- Improved error messages for unsupported files
- Added file input reset after upload

### Lessons Learned
- File picker accept attribute benefits from explicit extensions
- Always provide fallback validation
- Test on different OS/browser combinations

## Fixed Bugs Summary

1. **Audio Panel Rendering** ✅
   - Added missing case in render switch
   - Panel now displays correctly

2. **File Upload Selection** ✅
   - Fixed accept attribute
   - MP3s now selectable

3. **File Input Reset** ✅
   - Input now clears after upload
   - Allows re-uploading same file

---

## Known Limitations (Not Bugs)

1. **Single Audio Track**
   - Design decision: one audio per project
   - Can be replaced but not layered

2. **No Waveform Visualization**
   - Placeholder shown instead
   - Future enhancement opportunity

3. **Basic Trim Controls**
   - Slider-based only
   - No precise waveform trimming

4. **No Fade Effects**
   - Audio cuts in/out sharply
   - Could add fade controls later

---

## Performance Notes

- Audio loads asynchronously
- Preview recompilation debounced
- File size limited to 50MB
- No impact on video rendering speed

---

## Browser Compatibility

Tested and working on:
- Chrome (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Edge (latest)

All browsers support:
- File upload
- Audio playback
- Trim controls
- Volume adjustment

## Debug Helpers Added

Console logging for troubleshooting:
- `[AudioPanel] Rendering with projectId:`
- `[AudioPanel] File selected:` (with file details)
- `[AudioPanel] Upload button clicked`
- `[AudioPanel] No file selected`

These can be removed in production but helpful for debugging upload issues.
