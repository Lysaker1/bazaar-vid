  - Real-time audio trimming with start/end time sliders
  - Volume control (0-100%)
  - Preview playback with loop within trim range
  - Visual progress indicator
  - Clean removal option
- Integrated with Zustand video state for persistence

### 2. Infrastructure Updates

#### Upload API Route
- Extended to accept audio files (audio/* MIME types)
- Added 50MB file size limit for audio
- Stores audio in dedicated `/audio/` path in R2

#### Video State Store
- Added AudioTrack interface with properties:
  - id, url, name, duration
  - startTime, endTime (for trimming)
  - volume (0-1 range)
- Added updateProjectAudio method for state management
- Audio persists per project

### 3. Video Integration

#### PreviewPanelG
- Updated to include Remotion Audio component in compositions
- Audio data passed via window.projectAudio before module import
- Supports both single and multi-scene compositions
- Automatic frame conversion (seconds to frames at 30fps)
- Re-compiles preview when audio changes

#### Workspace Integration
- Added Audio panel to panel definitions
- Added Music icon to sidebar navigation
- Panel accessible via sidebar click or drag

## Technical Implementation

### Audio in Remotion
```tsx
<Audio
  src={projectAudio.url}
  startFrom={Math.floor(projectAudio.startTime * 30)}
  endAt={Math.floor(projectAudio.endTime * 30)}
  volume={projectAudio.volume}
/>
```

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Simple Overlay Approach**: Audio is a simple overlay, not integrated into AI prompts
2. **Manual Control**: Users have full control over trim and volume
3. **Project-Level Audio**: One audio track per project (can be changed anytime)
4. **Automatic Looping**: Audio loops if shorter than video duration

## Usage Flow
1. User clicks Audio panel in sidebar
2. Uploads MP3 file via button or drag-drop
3. Audio loads with full duration
4. User adjusts trim start/end points
5. User adjusts volume as needed
6. Audio automatically plays in preview
7. Audio included in final export

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)
- Multiple audio tracks
- Fade in/out controls
- Audio visualization/waveform
- AI-aware audio integration
- Sound effects library
