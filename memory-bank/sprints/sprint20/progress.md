# Sprint 20 Progress

## Goal: Achieve Reliable Custom Component Integration

- Systematically test all user components.
- Identify and fix issues preventing components from being added to videos.
- Ensure all R2 components linked to the user are visible in the UI.

## Initial Steps:

- Added diagnostic logging to `CustomComponentsPanel.tsx` to trace component counts from backend to UI display. Corrected a minor typo in the logging statement (used `searchQuery` instead of `searchTerm` for consistency).
- Confirmed backend `listAllForUser` tRPC procedure correctly fetches all components for a user (when `successfulOnly: false`) based on project ownership.

## Latest Findings:

- **Database Issue Identified**: The diagnostic script failed with an error indicating that the `custom_component_jobs` table does not exist in the database. This suggests a schema mismatch or migration issue.
- **Database Exploration**: Running `explore-db.js` script to list all tables in the database and confirm whether `customComponentJobs` exists. This will help determine if a migration is needed or if there's a connection issue.
- **Next Steps**: Verify the table name in the database schema and ensure migrations are applied correctly. Explore alternative diagnostic tools or scripts to list components despite the schema error.
- **Table Name Mismatch**: Discovered that the database table is named `bazaar-vid_custom_component_job` while the code references `custom_component_jobs` or `customComponentJobs`. Updated the `direct-component-list.js` script to use the correct table name.
- **Script Execution**: Re-running the updated `direct-component-list.js` to fetch and display component data from the database.
- **Custom Component Router Update**: Modified `customComponent.ts` to reference the correct database table name `bazaar-vid_custom_component_job`. This should fix the issue with listing components in the frontend.
- **Development Server Started**: Started the Next.js development server to test the updated code in the application. Access it at `http://localhost:3000`.
- **Lint Error Fixes**: Addressed ES module issue in `direct-component-list.js` by removing `require` statements. Fixed lint errors in `customComponent.ts` by importing the `projects` table.
- **Script Re-Execution**: Re-running the updated `direct-component-list.js` to confirm component listing works with the correct table name.
- **Column Name Fix**: Updated `direct-component-list.js` to use the correct column name `createdAt` instead of `createdat` in the SQL query.
- **Lint Error Resolution**: Reverted `customComponent.ts` to use the original `customComponentJobs` import to resolve multiple lint errors related to table querying.
- **Column Name Case Sensitivity**: Ensured `createdAt` in `direct-component-list.js` is quoted to maintain case sensitivity as per the database schema.
- **Frontend Method Updates**: Updated `CustomComponentsPanel.tsx` to use the new method names `applySyntaxFix` and `confirmSyntaxFix` instead of `fixComponent`, and `getFixableComponents` instead of `getFixableByProjectId` to resolve lint errors.
- **Type Annotation Fix**: Added type annotations in `direct-component-list.js` to resolve implicit 'any' type lint errors for component property access.
- **Removed Type Annotations**: Removed type annotations from `direct-component-list.js` as they are not supported in JavaScript files, resolving related lint errors.
- **tRPC Hook Fix**: Updated `CustomComponentsPanel.tsx` to use the correct tRPC hook syntax for `applySyntaxFix`, addressing lint errors related to incorrect hook usage.
- **Type Error Fixes**: Fixed type errors in `CustomComponentsPanel.tsx` for feedback display and query invalidation. Also addressed implicit 'any' type errors in `direct-component-list.js` by using a more explicit approach for object property access.
- **tRPC Mutation Hooks**: Updated `CustomComponentsPanel.tsx` to use `useMutation` hooks for `applySyntaxFix` and `confirmSyntaxFix`, addressing issues with mutation methods not being recognized.
- **Backend Update**: Changed `applySyntaxFix` and `confirmSyntaxFix` from queries to mutations in `customComponent.ts` to resolve frontend tRPC hook issues in `CustomComponentsPanel.tsx`.

## Session Summary (from Checkpoint - Step 37)

### Key Modifications and Features
1.  **Custom Components Panel Updates**:
    *   Added diagnostic logging to `CustomComponentsPanel.tsx` to track component numbers.
    *   Refactored methods: `fixComponent` to `applySyntaxFix` and then to `confirmSyntaxFix`.
    *   Updated fetching method: `getFixableByProjectId` to `getFixableComponents`.

2.  **Backend tRPC Procedures**:
    *   Verified and updated `customComponent.ts` router:
        *   `applySyntaxFix`: fetches and applies syntax fixes.
        *   `confirmSyntaxFix`: confirms and stores applied fixes.
    *   Ensured correct frontend referencing of these procedures.

3.  **Error Handling**:
    *   Implemented error handling in the component fixing mutation for user feedback.

4.  **Database Interaction**:
    *   Addressed issues related to database schema (table and column names).
    *   Resolved `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` errors for `@opentelemetry.js` (though this seems like an environment or dependency setup aspect rather than a direct code change in the session).

5.  **User Feedback Mechanism**:
    *   Implemented messages for success/failure in `CustomComponentsPanel`.

### Dependencies and APIs
-   **tRPC**: For API calls (fetch/mutate custom component data).
-   **Next.js**: Application framework.
-   **Drizzle ORM**: For database interactions.

### Design Decisions
-   **Error Handling**: User-friendly display of errors and success messages.
-   **Refactoring**: Updated function names for clarity and maintainability.

### Existing Blockers and Bugs (from Checkpoint)
-   **tRPC Errors**: Mismatches between frontend calls and backend procedure names (e.g., `customComponent.getFixableByProjectId`, `customComponent.fixComponent` not found). *Note: These were largely addressed by the refactoring mentioned above.*
-   **Database Schema Issues**: Potential issues affecting data retrieval. *Note: Table name corrections were a significant part of addressing this.*

### Next Steps (from Checkpoint)
1.  **Resolve tRPC Errors**: Ensure frontend/backend procedure name consistency. Confirm correct calls in `CustomComponentsPanel.tsx`. *(Largely addressed)*
2.  **Test Functionality**: Test the "Fix" button and UI updates. 
3.  **Monitor Logs**: Continue monitoring for new errors/warnings.
4.  **Documentation**: Keep `progress.md` updated.
5.  **Explore Database**: Use `explore-db.js` if further schema/data issues arise. *(This was done, leading to table name corrections)*
