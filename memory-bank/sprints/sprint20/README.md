# Sprint 20: Fixing Custom Component Generation Pipeline

## Overview

Sprint 20 focuses on addressing critical failures in our LLM-based component generation pipeline. We've discovered that components are failing at the validation step before they can reach our build system, which has robust capabilities to fix various structural issues.

## Problem

As detailed in our recent testing and production monitoring:

- Components are failing with syntax errors such as:
  - `Identifier 'frame' has already been declared`
  - `Unexpected token '<'`
- These errors occur during pre-compilation validation in `generateComponentCode.ts`
- The components never reach the database with "generated" status
- The build system (`buildCustomComponent.ts`) never gets a chance to apply its fixes

## Solution Components

This sprint delivers:

1. **[Problem Analysis](./01-problem-analysis.md)**: Comprehensive analysis of component generation failures
2. **[Proposed Solutions](./02-proposed-solutions.md)**: Two-pronged approach with code preprocessor and prompt enhancements
3. **[Test-Driven Validation](./03-test-driven-validation.md)**: Test cases covering all identified error patterns
4. **[TSX Preprocessor](../../src/server/utils/tsxPreprocessor.ts)**: Utility that fixes common syntax errors
5. **[Integration Plan](./implementation-plan.md)**: 5-day rollout plan for integrating the fixes

## Key Improvements

The TSX preprocessor (`tsxPreprocessor.ts`) addresses:

- ✅ Variable redeclaration through regex detection
- ✅ Unescaped characters in string literals
- ✅ Missing export statements
- ✅ Tag matching verification
- ✅ Improved LLM prompts with explicit syntax guidelines

## Expected Impact

With these improvements, we expect:

- Increase component generation success rate from ~0% to >80%
- Reduce "black screen" experiences in the preview panel
- Improve overall user satisfaction with the custom component feature
- Create a more robust foundation for future component generation features
