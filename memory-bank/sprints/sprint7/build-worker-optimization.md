# Build Worker Optimizations (Sprint 7, Ticket #4)

## Overview

This document outlines the optimizations implemented for the custom component build worker system in Sprint 7. These changes improve performance, stability, and observability of the component build system.

## Key Optimizations

### 1. TSX Code Wrapping

To reduce bundle sizes and improve loading times, we now wrap the generated TSX code with global React and Remotion references. This allows us to:

- Set `external: ['react', 'remotion']` in esbuild configuration
- Keep the dependencies out of each component bundle
- Reduce bundle sizes by >90% in most cases
- Drastically improve component loading performance in the preview

The wrapping function (`wrapTsxWithGlobals`) ensures that components can still access React and Remotion APIs without importing them directly.

### 2. Worker Pool with Concurrency Limits

We've implemented a simple worker pool that limits concurrent build operations to `cpuCount - 1` threads. This:

- Prevents CPU saturation during high load
- Keeps one core free for other server tasks
- Improves overall server stability
- Queues additional jobs until capacity is available

### 3. Performance Metrics

We now record detailed metrics for each component build:

- Build duration in milliseconds
- Success/failure status
- Error types and counts
- Job identifiers for correlation

These metrics are stored in the `metrics` table and can be used for:
- Monitoring build performance
- Identifying bottlenecks
- Tracking error rates
- Setting up alerts for build failures

## New Utility: Metrics System

A new metrics utility (`src/lib/metrics.ts`) standardizes metric collection throughout the application:

- `recordMetric(name, value, tags)`: Record a named metric with value and optional tags
- `measureDuration(name, fn, tags)`: Measure execution time of an async function

## Configuration

Key configuration values:

- `MAX_CONCURRENT_BUILDS`: Set to `cpuCount - 1` to maintain server responsiveness
- esbuild settings:
  - `format: "esm"`: Modern ES modules format
  - `external: ["react", "remotion", ...]`: Keep these dependencies external
  - `minify: true`: Reduce bundle size

## Benefits

These optimizations deliver significant improvements:

1. **Performance**: Smaller bundles load faster in the preview
2. **Stability**: Limited concurrency prevents CPU overload
3. **Observability**: Metrics provide visibility into system performance
4. **Scalability**: Worker pool can handle more jobs without overwhelming the server

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements:

1. Replace the simple worker pool with Piscina for more advanced job scheduling
2. Add caching for identical builds to reduce redundant work
3. Implement circuit breakers to prevent repeated failures
4. Add more detailed build metrics (parse time, bundle time, upload time)
