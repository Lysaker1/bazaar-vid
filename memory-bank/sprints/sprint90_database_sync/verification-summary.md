# Sprint 90 Verification Summary

## Verification Date: 2025-08-01

I've re-verified all findings from the Sprint 90 analysis. Here's the current status:

## ‚úÖ CONFIRMED - Critical Issues Still Present

### 1. Type Mismatches in `bazaar-vid_exports` ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
**Production is WRONG:**
- `id`: text (should be uuid)
- `user_id`: text (should be varchar(255))
- `project_id`: text (should be uuid)

**Dev is CORRECT:**
- `id`: uuid ‚úì
- `user_id`: varchar(255) ‚úì
- `project_id`: uuid ‚úì

### 2. Type Mismatch in `bazaar-vid_export_analytics` ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
**Production is WRONG:**
- `export_id`: text (should be uuid to match exports.id)

**Dev is CORRECT:**
- `export_id`: uuid ‚úì

### 3. Duplicate API Metrics Table ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS CLEANUP
- Dev has only: `api_usage_metric` (without prefix)
- Prod has BOTH: `api_usage_metric` AND `bazaar-vid_api_usage_metric`
- Code uses: `bazaar-vid_api_usage_metric` (with prefix)
- Action: Delete `api_usage_metric` from both environments

### 4. Auth Schemas ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- Dev has: `auth`, `neon_auth`, `pgrst` schemas
- Prod has: None of these
- Decision: NOT NEEDED (app uses NextAuth.js, not database auth)

## ‚úÖ VERIFIED - Unused Tables

### Empty Tables (0 rows in production):
1. `bazaar-vid_component_error` - 0 rows
2. `bazaar-vid_patch` - 0 rows
3. `bazaar-vid_scene_plan` - 0 rows
4. `bazaar-vid_scene_specs` - 0 rows

### Legacy Tables with Data:
1. `bazaar-vid_project_memory` - 671 rows (increased from 621)
2. `bazaar-vid_metric` - 389 rows (unchanged)
3. `bazaar-vid_agent_message` - 3 rows (unchanged)

## üìù Updates Since Original Analysis

### 1. Documentation Correction
- Original docs said Dev had `text` for export_analytics.export_id
- Actually: Dev has `uuid` (correct), Prod has `text` (wrong)

### 2. Row Count Changes
- `project_memory` increased from 621 to 671 rows (+50)
- Other counts remain the same

### 3. Schema.ts Update
- The schema file was recently modified (user noted this)
- New tables added in schema.ts: `promoCodes`, `promoCodeUsage`, `paywallEvents`, `paywallAnalytics`
- These tables don't exist in either database yet

## üö® Action Items Priority

### CRITICAL - Fix Type Mismatches:
1. Fix `bazaar-vid_exports` in production (text ‚Üí uuid/varchar)
2. Fix `bazaar-vid_export_analytics` in production (text ‚Üí uuid)

### HIGH - Remove Duplicates:
1. Delete `api_usage_metric` table from both DBs
2. Keep only `bazaar-vid_api_usage_metric`

### MEDIUM - Clean Empty Tables:
1. Delete 4 empty tables (component_error, patch, scene_plan, scene_specs)

### LOW - Investigate Legacy:
1. Check if project_memory (671 rows) is still needed
2. Check if metric (389 rows) is still needed
3. Check if agent_message (3 rows) is still needed

## Summary
All critical findings from the original Sprint 90 analysis are CONFIRMED and still need to be addressed. The migration plan remains valid and ready to execute.
