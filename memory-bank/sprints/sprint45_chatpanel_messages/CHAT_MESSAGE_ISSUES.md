# Chat Panel Message Issues & Solution

## Current Problems

1. **Hardcoded "complexity feedback" messages** that make no sense:
   - "‚ö° Lightning-fast edit incoming!"
   - "üèóÔ∏è This is a bigger change ‚Äî restructuring the layout..."
   - These are shown BEFORE we know what's happening

2. **Timing inconsistencies**:
   - Shows "Trimming... now" with past tense timing "(10.8s)"
   - After refresh, loses the timing info
   - Messages don't match actual operations

3. **Missing clarification messages**:
   - When brain asks for clarification, user sees "scene operation successful"
   - Actual clarification question is lost

4. **State persistence issues**:
   - Messages change after page refresh
   - Timing information disappears

## Root Causes

1. Messages are generated at different stages without coordination
2. Using generic placeholders instead of actual operation info
3. No proper state management for message updates
4. Mixing present/past tense randomly

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Remove ALL hardcoded complexity feedback
- Delete the entire `getComplexityFeedback` function
- No more random "creative magic" or "surgical precision" messages

### 2. Use actual operation information
- Show what's ACTUALLY happening from the brain/tool response
- Use the `chatResponse` from the orchestrator/tools

### 3. Consistent message flow
```
User: "make it blue"
Assistant: "I'll change the color to blue for you."
[After completion]: "Changed the color to blue. ‚úì (2.3s)"
```

### 4. Handle clarifications properly
- If brain returns clarification, show ONLY that
- No "operation successful" for clarifications

### 5. Simple implementation
- Use the response data we already have
- No complex polling or state management
- Just show what the AI actually said
