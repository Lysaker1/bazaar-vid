# Sprint 81: Context Engineering - Implementation Summary

**Date:** July 22, 2025  
**Status:** COMPLETED ✅  
**Implementer:** Claude

## Overview

We implemented a smart, AI-driven asset persistence system that ensures uploaded assets (images, logos, videos) are available throughout the entire project lifecycle. The system uses the existing `projectMemory` table and trusts the AI to make intelligent decisions about when to use existing assets vs. creating new ones.

## What Was Built

### 1. Asset Context Service
**File:** `/src/server/services/context/assetContextService.ts`

A service that manages persistent asset storage using the existing `projectMemory` table:
- Saves uploaded assets with metadata (URL, type, name, hash, tags)
- Retrieves all project assets organized by type
- Automatically detects and tags logos
- No new database migrations needed - uses existing infrastructure

### 2. Enhanced Upload Route
**File:** `/src/app/api/upload/route.ts`

Modified to save asset metadata after successful upload:
```typescript
// After successful R2 upload
const asset: Asset = {
  id: crypto.randomUUID(),
  url: publicUrl,
  type: assetType, // image, video, audio, logo
  fileSize: file.size,
  originalName: file.name,
  hash: fileHash,
  tags: assetType === 'logo' ? ['logo', 'brand'] : [],
  uploadedAt: new Date(),
  usageCount: 0
};

await assetContext.saveAsset(projectId, asset, metadata);
```

### 3. Context Builder Enhancement
**File:** `/src/brain/orchestrator_functions/contextBuilder.ts`

Enhanced to retrieve and include persistent assets:
- Fetches all project assets from `assetContextService`
- Adds asset context to the `ContextPacket`
- Provides organized access: all assets, logos, recent uploads

### 4. Brain Orchestrator Updates
**Files:** 
- `/src/config/prompts/active/brain-orchestrator.ts`
- `/src/brain/orchestrator_functions/intentAnalyzer.ts`

Added project asset awareness:
- Brain now receives information about all previously uploaded assets
- Understands references like "the logo", "my image", "that file from before"
- Makes intelligent decisions about when to use existing assets
- Passes relevant asset URLs to tools through `toolContext`

### 5. Tool Integration
**Files:**
- `/src/tools/helpers/types.ts` - Added `assetUrls` to `BaseToolInput`
- `/src/server/api/routers/generation/helpers.ts` - Passes asset URLs to tools
- `/src/tools/add/add.ts` - Forwards asset URLs to code generator
- `/src/tools/add/add_helpers/CodeGeneratorNEW.ts` - Uses asset context

Tools now receive asset URLs and include them as context when generating code:
```typescript
// In code generation
if (input.assetUrls && input.assetUrls.length > 0) {
  userPrompt += `\n\nPROJECT ASSETS AVAILABLE:`;
  input.assetUrls.forEach(url => {
    userPrompt += `\n- ${url}`;
  });
  userPrompt += `\n\nThese are previously uploaded assets in this project. Use them when appropriate based on the user's request.`;
}
```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. No Hard Constraints
Instead of rigid validation rules, we trust the AI to understand context:
- No mandatory asset usage
- No blocking of external images
- No regex patterns for placeholder detection
- AI decides based on user intent

### 2. Using Existing Infrastructure
- Leveraged `projectMemory` table instead of creating new tables
- Used existing type system with minimal additions
- Integrated seamlessly with current data flow

### 3. Intelligent Context Awareness
The system provides context without being prescriptive:
- "These are available assets" not "You must use these"
- "Use when appropriate" not "Always use these"
- Allows for both asset reuse and new asset creation

## Data Flow

```
1. User uploads image/video/audio
   ↓
2. Upload API saves to R2 + saves metadata to projectMemory
   ↓
3. User makes request: "Add a scene with the logo"
   ↓
4. Context Builder retrieves all project assets
   ↓
5. Brain Orchestrator sees assets + understands "the logo"
   ↓
6. Brain passes logo URL in toolContext.assetUrls
   ↓
7. Add Tool receives asset URLs
   ↓
8. Code Generator includes assets in prompt context
   ↓
9. Generated code uses the correct logo URL
```

## Benefits

1. **Persistence**: Assets are available throughout project lifetime
2. **Intelligence**: AI understands context and user intent
3. **Flexibility**: No rigid rules that limit creativity
4. **Simplicity**: Uses existing infrastructure
5. **Scalability**: Efficient storage in projectMemory

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Upload logo** → "Add intro with the logo" → Logo appears
2. **Upload multiple images** → "Use that sunset image" → Correct image used
3. **No uploads** → "Add a beach scene" → AI finds/creates appropriate image
4. **Mixed context** → "Add the logo on a new background" → Uses logo + creates background

## Future Enhancements

1. **Asset Preview**: Show uploaded assets in UI sidebar
2. **Asset Management**: Allow users to delete/rename assets
3. **Smart Tagging**: AI-powered asset categorization
4. **Usage Analytics**: Track which assets are used most

## Code Quality

- ✅ TypeScript types added for asset context
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing APIs
- ✅ Follows existing patterns and conventions
- ✅ Error handling for failed asset saves
- ✅ Logging for debugging

## Conclusion

The Context Engineering implementation successfully solves the problem of "hallucinated" placeholder images by ensuring the AI is always aware of available project assets. The solution is elegant, flexible, and trusts the AI to make intelligent decisions based on user intent rather than enforcing rigid rules.
