# Principles vs Rules - A Better Approach

## The Problem with Our Current Approach
- Too many NEVER/ALWAYS rules
- Prompt getting bloated
- Too rigid - can't adapt to context
- Fighting symptoms, not addressing root cause

## What Makes Good Motion Graphics?

### Core Principle: Clarity Through Time
Motion graphics excel when they guide attention deliberately through time. Each moment should have a clear purpose and focus.

### Natural Patterns (Not Rules)
1. **Breathing Room** - Elements need space (temporal and spatial) to be understood
2. **Visual Hierarchy** - Not everything is equally important at every moment
3. **Narrative Flow** - Like telling a story, not building a slide

### Flexible Approaches
- **Sequential**: One thing at a time (good for key messages)
- **Layered**: Multiple elements with clear primary/secondary roles
- **Transformative**: Elements evolve into each other
- **Persistent**: Some elements (like backgrounds) can stay

## Better Prompt Strategy

Instead of:
```
NEVER stack vertically
ALWAYS use center
NEVER leave things on screen
```

We should communicate:
```
Create motion graphics that guide the viewer's attention naturally through time. 
Consider what needs focus at each moment.
Use space and timing to create clarity.
```

## The Real Issue

The AI is defaulting to "website layout" thinking. We need to shift its mental model to "time-based storytelling" without being prescriptive about HOW to achieve that.
