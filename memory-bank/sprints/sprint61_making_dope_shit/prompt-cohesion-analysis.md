# Prompt Cohesion Analysis

## Current Issues

### 1. Mixed Messages
- Philosophy: "Think like a film director"
- Structure: "Supporting elements stagger in" (sounds like PowerPoint)
- Layout: Rigid rules that assume website-style layouts

### 2. Order Problems
- Technical rules come first (necessary but dry)
- Philosophy comes after technical details (should set the tone)
- Specific timings before understanding the approach

### 3. Conflicting Guidance
- "NEVER use absolute positioning for related elements"
- But centered, sequential storytelling often needs absolute positioning
- "Supporting elements stagger in" vs "one thought at a time"

## Suggested Reordering

1. **Start with Philosophy** - Set the mental model first
2. **Core Principles** - What makes good motion graphics
3. **Technical Requirements** - How to implement in Remotion
4. **Patterns & Examples** - Concrete implementations
5. **Output Requirements** - What to deliver

## Key Changes Needed

### Remove Contradictions
- Update "SCENE DURATION & STRUCTURE" to align with temporal storytelling
- Make layout rules more flexible
- Remove prescriptive patterns that conflict with philosophy

### Strengthen Core Message
- Motion graphics = time-based storytelling
- Every technical decision should support this
- Flexibility in implementation, consistency in principle

### Simplify
- Combine similar sections
- Remove redundant instructions
- Focus on what matters most
