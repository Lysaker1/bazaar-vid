# Animation Section Improvements - Code Generator Prompt

## Overview
Enhanced the animation section of the code generator prompt to create more sophisticated, context-aware motion graphics with better variety and visual impact.

## Key Improvements

### 1. COMPREHENSIVE TIMING SYSTEM
- Added specific frame counts for different animation types
- Differentiated between micro-animations (4-8 frames) and complex sequences (20-30 frames)
- Element-specific timing (headlines, buttons, data, etc.)

### 2. EASING FUNCTION LIBRARY
Added 6 essential easing functions with clear use cases:
- `easeOutExpo` - Snappy entrances
- `easeOutBack` - Playful bounce/overshoot
- `easeOutElastic` - Attention-grabbing effects
- `easeInQuart` - Quick, smooth exits
- `easeInExpo` - Dramatic exits
- `easeInOutCubic` - Smooth transitions

### 3. CONTEXT-AWARE ANIMATION PATTERNS

#### Text Animations
- Type-on effect for important messages
- Word-by-word reveal for headlines
- Character stagger for emphasis

#### UI Elements
- Directional slides based on position
- Scale + rotate combinations
- Unfold effects for panels

#### Data Visualizations
- Count-up animations for numbers
- Progressive path drawing for charts
- Staggered bar growth

#### Emphasis & Continuous
- Subtle pulses for CTAs
- Glow effects for highlights
- Ambient floating motion

### 4. SOPHISTICATED TRANSITIONS
- Morph transitions between elements
- Connected flow with path animations
- Proper exit/entrance overlap timing

### 5. CONTEXT-BASED SELECTION
Animations now adapt based on:
- **Content Type**: Security, Finance, Social, Tech, Fashion
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Primary, Secondary, Background
- **Emotional Tone**: Urgent, Calm, Playful, Professional

### 6. STAGGER PATTERNS
Three distinct stagger types:
- **CASCADE**: Top-to-bottom sequential reveal
- **RADIAL**: Elements emerge from center
- **SCATTER**: Random particle-like appearance

### 7. EXIT STRATEGIES
- **Momentum Exit**: Continues motion direction
- **Collapse Exit**: Scales down to point
- **Shatter Exit**: Breaks into pieces

### 8. IMAGE-BASED CONTEXT
Added specific animation guidance for different image types:
- App Screenshots: UI-aware animations
- Product Photos: Feature highlighting
- Data Visualizations: Progressive reveals
- People/Portraits: Soft, engaging motion
- Logos/Brands: Personality-driven animation

## Impact

### Before
- Only spring scale-in animation
- Fixed 8-12 frame timing
- No context awareness
- Basic enter/exit patterns

### After
- 15+ animation patterns
- Variable timing based on purpose
- Smart context-based selection
- Sophisticated transition techniques
- Image content awareness

## Technical Improvements
- Proper code examples within the prompt
- Clear implementation patterns
- Easing functions ready to copy/paste
- Frame-specific timing guidance

## Next Steps
1. Test with various prompts to verify improvements
2. Monitor generation quality
3. Collect feedback on animation sophistication
4. Consider adding more specialized patterns (glitch, liquid, morph)

The enhanced prompt should now generate motion graphics that are more dynamic, contextual, and visually sophisticated - moving from "decent" to "dope" as intended.
