# Direct Approach - No Metaphors

## Just Say What It Is

Instead of:
```
"Think of yourself as directing a TED talk..."
"Imagine a slide projector..."
"Think like a film director..."
```

Just say:
```
You are creating MOTION GRAPHICS - dynamic videos where elements animate in, perform, and exit over time.

Good motion graphics show one key message at a time. Elements enter the frame, capture attention, deliver their message, then exit to make room for the next element.

This is NOT a website where everything stays visible. This is VIDEO - use time to control what the viewer sees.
```

## Why Metaphors Failed

1. **TED talk** - Still implies static slides
2. **Film director** - Too vague, could mean anything
3. **Slide projector** - Outdated reference
4. **PowerPoint** - We use it as negative example but it reinforces the wrong model

## Better Direct Statements

```
WHAT YOU'RE CREATING:
Motion graphics are videos that use animated text, shapes, and graphics to communicate ideas.

HOW MOTION GRAPHICS WORK:
- Show one main element at a time
- Elements animate in → deliver message → animate out
- Use the full screen for each key point
- Create flow through time, not layout in space

DEFAULT BEHAVIOR:
Center each main element. Show it alone. Remove it before showing the next.
```

No metaphors. No analogies. Just clear, direct explanation of what motion graphics are and how they work.
