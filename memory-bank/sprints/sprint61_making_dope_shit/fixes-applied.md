# Sprint 61 - Fixes Applied

## Issues Found During Testing

1. **React Import Breaking** ❌
   - AI was importing `useState, useEffect` which broke the code
   - FIXED: Added explicit React hook access to rules

2. **White Fadeout on Every Scene** ❌
   - Exit animations were too aggressive
   - FIXED: Removed automatic exit animations from structure

3. **Pattern Not Following** ❌
   - Transition context wasn't explicit enough
   - FIXED: Added clear instructions for studying previous scene

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed React Hook Access
```javascript
// Added to technical rules:
2. React hooks if needed: const { useState, useEffect } = window.React;
```

### 2. Removed Automatic Exit Animations
```
BEFORE: 80-100%: Quick exit (all elements)
AFTER: 80-100%: Elements hold position (NO automatic fadeout)

Added: "Do NOT add exit animations unless explicitly requested"
```

### 3. Improved Transition Context
```typescript
// More explicit instructions:
IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Study the previous scene's visual style, colors, animation timing, and patterns
2. Create a NEW scene that maintains visual consistency
3. If previous elements exit in a direction, consider entering from the opposite
4. Match the pacing and energy of the previous scene
5. Use similar animation timing (if previous uses 8-12 frames, you should too)
```

### 4. Simplified User Prompts
Removed redundant instructions like:
- "Create engaging motion graphics"
- "Use modern animations with Framer Motion" (not supported!)
- "Default duration: 5 seconds"

Now just passes the user request directly.

## Result

- ✅ No more React import errors
- ✅ No automatic white fadeouts
- ✅ Better pattern following with explicit instructions
- ✅ Cleaner, more direct prompts

## Testing Next

Try these scenarios:
1. Create a scene with animations
2. Add another scene - should follow the style
3. No white fadeout between scenes
4. React hooks should work properly
