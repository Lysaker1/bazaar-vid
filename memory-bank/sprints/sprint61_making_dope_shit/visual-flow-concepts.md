# Visual Flow Concepts for Code Generator

## The Challenge
How to articulate "don't just stack everything" without being too rigid?

## Potential Approaches

### Option 1: Storytelling Metaphor
```
VISUAL STORYTELLING PRINCIPLES:
• Think of your scene as a story with chapters, not a poster
• Each "moment" should have a clear focus - what should the viewer look at NOW?
• Use time to guide attention: "First, notice this... then, look at that..."
• Major transitions between ideas - don't just accumulate elements
• Like a good presenter: make a point, let it land, then move to the next
```

### Option 2: Stage Direction
```
CHOREOGRAPHED ANIMATION FLOW:
• Treat the screen like a stage - not everyone performs at once
• Primary elements get the spotlight, others fade or exit
• When introducing new primary content, clear space for it
• Supporting elements can coexist but should never compete for attention
• Between major "acts", create visual breaks (fade, slide, transform)
```

### Option 3: Attention Management
```
ATTENTION FLOW PRINCIPLES:
• Guide the viewer's eye through time - don't overwhelm with everything at once
• Replace primary content rather than stacking it
• Use these patterns:
  - Sequential reveal: A enters → A exits → B enters
  - Layered focus: A enters → B supports A → Both exit → C enters
  - Transform transitions: A morphs into B
• Ask yourself: "What should the viewer focus on at frame X?"
```

### Option 4: Motion Graphics Best Practices
```
PROFESSIONAL MOTION GRAPHICS PATTERNS:
• Avoid "PowerPoint syndrome" - elements appearing and staying forever
• Create visual breathing room between major points
• Use exit animations to make space for new content
• Think in "scenes within a scene":
  - Opening statement (0-30%)
  - Main point (30-70%)  
  - Closing/transition (70-100%)
• Each major element should have an entrance, spotlight moment, and exit
```

### Option 5: The Documentary Approach
```
CINEMATIC COMPOSITION:
• Like a film editor - show one thing beautifully, then cut to the next
• Don't let the screen become cluttered with history
• Major content changes should feel like scene changes
• Supporting elements enhance but don't persist forever
• Create rhythm: Reveal → Focus → Transition → Reveal
```

## Recommended Hybrid Approach

Combine the best of these concepts:

```
MOTION DESIGN COMPOSITION:

• **Visual Flow**: Guide attention through time, not just space
• **Clear Focus**: Each moment should have an obvious focal point
• **Smart Transitions**: Major content changes need visual breaks
  - Exit previous primary element as new one enters
  - Use fades, slides, or morphs between "chapters"
  - Don't just stack - replace and refresh

• **Rhythm Patterns**:
  - Solo performance: One element commands full attention
  - Duet: Two complementary elements share focus  
  - Ensemble: Multiple elements, but with clear hierarchy
  - Scene change: Clear the stage for new content

• **Ask yourself**: "If I pause at any frame, is it clear what to look at?"
```

This gives flexibility while encouraging better composition!
