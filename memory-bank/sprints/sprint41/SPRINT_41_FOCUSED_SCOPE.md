# Sprint 41: Focused Scope (Single Source of Truth)

## Sprint Goal: Fix Architecture Only

**One sentence**: Move tool execution from brain to generation.ts and fix field naming inconsistencies.

## What We ARE Doing (5 days)

### Day 1-2: Fix Execution Location ‚úÖ (DONE)
- [x] Create decision-only orchestrator
- [x] Move tool execution to generation.ts
- [x] Remove unnecessary wrappers (sceneBuilderNEW)

### Day 3: Fix Field Naming üî¥ (CURRENT)
- [ ] Change all `sceneCode` to `tsxCode` in tool types
- [ ] Change all `sceneName` to `name` in tool types
- [ ] Ensure DB field names used everywhere
- [ ] Zero transformations

### Day 4: Integrate & Clean üü°
- [ ] Switch ChatPanelG to use generationV2
- [ ] Remove old orchestrator (2442 lines)
- [ ] Remove toolExecutor from brain
- [ ] Integrate normalized VideoState (if it exists and works)

### Day 5: Test & Verify üü°
- [ ] Test all operations (add/edit/delete)
- [ ] Verify field names end-to-end
- [ ] Clean up unused files
- [ ] Document final architecture

## What We are NOT Doing (Save for Sprint 42+)

‚ùå Multi-step workflows (already works with current tools)
‚ùå Version control system
‚ùå Transaction support
‚ùå New MCP tool improvements
‚ùå Prompt simplification (beyond basic cleanup)
‚ùå Performance optimizations
‚ùå New features of any kind

## Clear Decisions

### 1. Tools vs Services
**Decision**: Keep the new `/src/tools/` structure
**Why**: It's already working and follows Sprint 40's modular vision
**Action**: Delete old `/src/server/services/scene/` after migration

### 2. Which Orchestrator
**Decision**: Use our new decision-only orchestrator
**Why**: It properly separates concerns
**Action**: Delete old 2442-line orchestrator

### 3. Which VideoState
**Decision**: Find and use normalized VideoState if it exists, otherwise keep current
**Why**: Optimistic UI is good but not critical for architecture fix
**Action**: Quick search, integrate if easy, skip if complex

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Brain only makes decisions (< 100 lines)
‚úÖ Generation.ts handles all execution
‚úÖ Field names match database exactly
‚úÖ No transformation layers
‚úÖ All tests pass
‚úÖ No new features added

## Out of Scope

Everything not listed above. Period.

## Timeline

- Day 1-2: Execution location ‚úÖ DONE
- Day 3: Field naming (TODAY)
- Day 4: Integration
- Day 5: Testing & cleanup

## Next Immediate Action

Fix field naming in tool types:
1. Update `/src/tools/helpers/types.ts`
2. Update all tool implementations
3. Remove transformations in generation.ts
