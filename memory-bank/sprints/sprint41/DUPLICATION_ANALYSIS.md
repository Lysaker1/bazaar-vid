# Sprint 41: Complete Duplication Analysis

## Critical Finding: We Have 3+ Versions of Everything!

After the merge, we have massive duplication across the codebase:

## 1. Orchestrator/Brain (3 Versions!)

### Version 1: Original Monster
- **File**: `/src/server/services/brain/orchestrator.ts`
- **Size**: 2442 lines (94KB)
- **Status**: Old, should be removed

### Version 2: Simplified 
- **File**: `/src/server/services/brain/orchestrator.simplified.ts`
- **Size**: ~200 lines (5.6KB)
- **Status**: Sprint 40's attempt

### Version 3: New Modular
- **File**: `/src/brain/orchestratorNEW.ts`
- **Size**: ~60 lines
- **Status**: Currently in use (from restructure_brain)

## 2. MCP Tools (2 Complete Sets!)

### Set 1: Original MCP Tools
```
/src/server/services/mcp/tools/
├── addScene.ts (112 lines)
├── editScene.ts
├── deleteScene.ts
├── analyzeImage.ts
├── changeDuration.ts
├── createSceneFromImage.ts
├── editSceneWithImage.ts
└── fixBrokenScene.ts
```
**Total**: 8 tools

### Set 2: Simplified MCP Tools
```
/src/server/services/mcp/tools/simplified/
├── addScene.ts (61 lines - 50% smaller!)
├── editScene.ts
└── deleteScene.ts
```
**Total**: 3 tools (Sprint 40's vision)

## 3. Scene Management (3 Implementations!)

### Implementation 1: Original MCP Tools
- Direct tool usage
- Located in `/mcp/tools/`

### Implementation 2: New Tools Architecture
- From restructure_brain
- Located in `/src/tools/`
- Self-contained tools with helpers

### Implementation 3: Scene Services
- Mark-12's service pattern
- Located in `/src/server/services/scene/`
- Repository pattern with abstraction

## 4. VideoState (4 Versions!)

1. `/src/stores/videoState.ts` - Original nested
2. `/src/stores/videoState.normalized.ts` - Sprint 40's flat structure
3. `/src/stores/videoState-simple.ts` - Another attempt
4. `/src/stores/videoState-hybrid.ts` - Yet another variant

## 5. Generation Router (2 Versions!)

1. `/src/server/api/routers/generation.ts` - Current (uses orchestratorNEW)
2. `/src/server/api/routers/generation.simplified.ts` - Sprint 40 version

## 6. Other Duplications

### SceneBuilder Service
- `sceneBuilder.service.ts` - Current
- `sceneBuilder.service.updated.ts` - Parallel implementation

### Context Builder
- `contextBuilder.service.ts` - Current
- `contextBuilder.service.ts.backup` - Backup during refactor

### Index Files
- `index.ts` - Exports all 8 tools
- `index.simplified.ts` - Exports only 4 tools

## The Real Problem

We're trying to maintain 3 parallel architectures:

### Architecture 1: Original (Pre-Sprint 40)
- 2442-line orchestrator
- 8 MCP tools
- Nested VideoState
- Complex flows

### Architecture 2: Sprint 40 Vision
- 100-line orchestrator
- 3 simplified tools
- Normalized VideoState
- Simple, direct approach

### Architecture 3: Restructure Brain
- Modular orchestrator with ToolExecutor
- New tools under `/src/tools/`
- Different organization
- Execution in wrong place

## What's Actually Running?

Currently, we have a **Frankenstein hybrid**:
- Brain: orchestratorNEW (from restructure_brain) ✅
- Tools: Mix of all three implementations 😱
- VideoState: Old nested version ❌
- Generation: Using new orchestrator ✅

## The Solution: Pick ONE Architecture

### Recommendation: Sprint 40 Vision with Best Parts

1. **Brain**: Use Sprint 40's simplified orchestrator (100 lines)
2. **Tools**: Use simplified MCP tools (3 tools only)
3. **Services**: Keep mark-12's service abstraction pattern
4. **VideoState**: Use normalized version
5. **Execution**: Move to generation.ts

### Files to Delete (Clean Up!)

```
DELETE:
❌ /src/server/services/brain/orchestrator.ts (2442 lines)
❌ /src/brain/ (entire directory - wrong location)
❌ /src/tools/ (entire directory - redundant)
❌ /src/stores/videoState.ts (old)
❌ /src/stores/videoState-simple.ts
❌ /src/stores/videoState-hybrid.ts
❌ /src/server/services/mcp/tools/*.ts (keep only simplified/)
❌ All .backup and .updated files
```

### Files to Keep:

```
KEEP:
✅ /src/server/services/brain/orchestrator.simplified.ts (rename to orchestrator.ts)
✅ /src/server/services/mcp/tools/simplified/ (move up one level)
✅ /src/server/services/scene/ (service pattern is good)
✅ /src/stores/videoState.normalized.ts (rename to videoState.ts)
✅ /src/server/api/routers/generation.ts (update to handle execution)
```

## The Path Forward

1. **Day 1**: Delete all duplicate files
2. **Day 2**: Consolidate to Sprint 40 architecture
3. **Day 3**: Fix execution location
4. **Day 4**: Test everything works
5. **Day 5**: Final cleanup

## Why This Matters

- **Confusion**: Developers don't know which version to use
- **Bugs**: Different versions have different behaviors
- **Maintenance**: 3x the code to maintain
- **Performance**: Loading unnecessary code
- **Clarity**: No clear architecture

## Conclusion

We need to **ruthlessly delete** duplicates and commit to Sprint 40's vision. The current state is unsustainable with 3+ versions of every major component.
