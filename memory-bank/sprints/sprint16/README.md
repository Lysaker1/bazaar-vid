# Sprint 16: Frontend Deep Dive - Remotion Video Update Investigation

**Goal:** Identify why the Remotion video preview is not updating with newly generated custom components and document the current system flow, potential issues, and alignment with Remotion best practices.

**Main Focus:**
- Understand the data flow from custom component generation to video state and Remotion player.
- Analyze the interaction between `videoState.ts`, JSON patches, `DynamicVideo.tsx`, `PreviewPanel.tsx`, and other relevant frontend components.
- Document findings extensively in this sprint folder to inform subsequent debugging and refactoring efforts.

**Key Activities:**
- Review existing codebase and documentation.
- Analyze Remotion integration and update mechanisms.
- Formulate hypotheses for the observed issues.
- Propose simplifications and adherence to Remotion best practices.

**Outcome:** A clear understanding of the problem and a well-documented path towards a solution. No direct coding changes in this initial phase, focus is on analysis and documentation.
