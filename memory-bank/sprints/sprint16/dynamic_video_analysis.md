# Analysis of `src/remotion/compositions/DynamicVideo.tsx`

This document will contain the detailed analysis of `DynamicVideo.tsx`, focusing on how it handles input props, renders scenes, and integrates custom components.

## Key Questions to Address:

1.  **Props Reception**: How does `DynamicVideo.tsx` receive and process its `inputProps`? What is the expected structure of these props, particularly the `scenes` array?
2.  **Scene Iteration/Mapping**: How does it iterate through the `scenes` array? Does it use `<Series>`, `Composition.Sequence`, or a direct map to render individual scenes?
3.  **Standard Scene Rendering**: How are standard (non-custom) scene types rendered?
4.  **Custom Scene Handling (`type: "custom"`)**:
    *   Is there specific logic to identify and handle scenes with `type: "custom"`?
    *   How does it pass props to the component responsible for rendering custom scenes (e.g., `CustomScene.tsx`)? What props are passed (especially `componentSourceUrl`)?
    *   How does it expect `CustomScene.tsx` (or equivalent) to load and render the component from the R2 URL?
5.  **Re-rendering Behavior**: How does `DynamicVideo.tsx` behave when `inputProps` change? Are there any memoization techniques (`React.memo`, `useMemo`) that might prevent re-renders if props are not changing identity correctly?
6.  **Error Handling**: Is there any error handling related to scene rendering, especially for custom components?
7.  **Dependencies**: What other components or utilities does `DynamicVideo.tsx` rely on from within the `src/remotion/` directory or elsewhere?
