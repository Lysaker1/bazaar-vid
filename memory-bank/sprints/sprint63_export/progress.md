# Sprint 63: Export Feature Progress

## Overview
Implementing video export functionality for Bazaar-Vid using AWS Lambda for serverless rendering.

## Progress Log

### Phase 1: Research & Analysis ✅
- Researched Remotion rendering options (SSR, Lambda, GitHub Actions)
- Created comprehensive architecture analysis document
- Decided to skip SSR and go straight to Lambda based on Remotion's recommendations

### Phase 2: Initial SSR Implementation (Abandoned) ✅
- Started with SSR approach but encountered critical issues:
  - Remotion requires client-side React context (incompatible with Next.js server components)
  - Multiple attempts to fix (dynamic imports, worker files) all failed
  - User decided to skip SSR entirely and focus on Lambda

### Phase 3: Lambda Implementation ✅
- Created Lambda-focused architecture with proper error messages
- Implemented full Lambda rendering service with:
  - Configuration checking
  - Site deployment to S3 with caching
  - Render job management
  - Progress tracking
  - Error handling with helpful messages
- Created webhook handler for render completion notifications
- Updated render router to support Lambda mode
- Enhanced ExportButton to handle S3 download URLs

### Phase 4: Documentation ✅
- Created comprehensive Lambda setup guide (`lambda-setup-guide.md`)
- Added example environment configuration (`.env.lambda.example`)
- Documented all required AWS setup steps

### Phase 5: AWS Setup & Initial Testing ✅
- User successfully completed AWS setup
- Deployed Lambda function and created S3 bucket
- Initial exports worked but showed placeholder content

### Phase 6: Scene Rendering Fix ✅
**Problem**: Exported videos showed "Invalid Scene" placeholders instead of actual content
**Root Cause**: Lambda environment couldn't compile TypeScript/JSX at runtime
**Solution**: Implemented server-side pre-compilation

#### Key Changes:
1. **Server-side preprocessing** (`render.service.ts`):
   - Pre-compile TypeScript to JavaScript using sucrase
   - Remove `window.Remotion` references
   - Convert `export default` to `const Component =`
   - Replace browser-specific globals
   - Stub unsupported features (fonts, icons)

2. **Lambda-compatible composition** (`MainCompositionSimple.tsx`):
   - Execute pre-compiled JavaScript safely
   - Inject Remotion functions at runtime
   - Provide fallback UI for failed scenes
   - Support dynamic duration calculation

3. **CLI service updates** (`lambda-cli.service.ts`):
   - Parse public S3 URLs from output
   - Handle scene preprocessing
   - Improved error handling

## Current Status - COMPLETE ✅

### Working Features
1. **Full Export Pipeline**
   - Click Export button → Lambda render → Download MP4
   - Actual scene content renders correctly
   - 10-20 second render times
   - Cost: $0.001-0.004 per export

2. **Scene Support**
   - Single scene projects ✅
   - Multi-scene projects ✅
   - Complex animations ✅
   - Dynamic durations ✅

3. **Technical Implementation**
   - Server-side TypeScript compilation
   - Lambda-safe code execution
   - Public S3 URLs for downloads
   - Progress tracking with real-time updates

## Technical Decisions

### Why Lambda Over SSR
1. **Remotion Limitations**: Cannot run in Next.js server components
2. **Performance**: Lambda offers parallel rendering (much faster)
3. **Scalability**: Serverless architecture scales automatically
4. **Cost**: Pay-per-use model better for SaaS
5. **Maintenance**: No infrastructure to manage

### Key Innovations
1. **Pre-compilation Pipeline**: Transform TypeScript → JavaScript before Lambda
2. **Dual Composition Strategy**: Full-featured for local, simplified for Lambda
3. **Safe Code Execution**: Sandboxed Function constructor with error boundaries
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Fallback UI when scenes can't render

## Files Modified/Created

### Core Implementation
- `/src/server/services/render/render.service.ts` - Scene preprocessing logic
- `/src/server/services/render/lambda-cli.service.ts` - CLI-based Lambda rendering
- `/src/remotion/MainCompositionSimple.tsx` - Lambda-compatible composition
- `/src/remotion/index.tsx` - Switch to simple composition

### Supporting Files
- `/src/server/api/routers/render.ts` - Lambda support and progress checking
- `/src/components/export/ExportButton.tsx` - S3 URL handling
- `/next.config.js` - Webpack externals for Remotion

### Documentation
- `/memory-bank/sprints/sprint63_export/lambda-setup-guide.md` - AWS setup
- `/memory-bank/sprints/sprint63_export/export-lambda-implementation.md` - Solution details
- `/memory-bank/sprints/sprint63_export/export-troubleshooting.md` - Common issues

## Performance & Cost

### Render Times
- Single scene (5s): ~10 seconds
- Multi-scene (30s): ~20 seconds
- Complex animations: May take longer

### Costs
- Per export: $0.001-0.004
- Monthly estimate (1000 exports): ~$3
- Storage: Minimal (temporary files)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Lambda Constraints**: No runtime compilation, limited libraries
2. **Pre-processing is Key**: Transform code before Lambda execution
3. **Simple is Better**: Removed complex features for Lambda compatibility
4. **User Feedback Critical**: Skipping SSR saved significant time

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **UI Improvements**
   - Format selection (webm, gif)
   - Quality presets
   - Export history

2. **Technical Enhancements**
   - Migrate to SDK approach
   - Add font support
   - Enable icon rendering
   - Webhook implementation

3. **Monitoring**
   - Cost tracking
   - Performance metrics
   - Error reporting

## Sprint Summary

**Started**: Research into export options
**Delivered**: Fully functional Lambda-based export with actual scene rendering
**Key Achievement**: Solved the TypeScript compilation challenge for Lambda
**User Impact**: Users can now export their motion graphics as MP4 files
