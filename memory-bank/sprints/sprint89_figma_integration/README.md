# Sprint 89: Figma Integration

## 🎯 Sprint Goal
Integrate Figma as a design source for Bazaar-Vid, enabling users to import and animate Figma designs directly in their video projects.

## 📋 Overview
This sprint adds Figma as a parallel source to our existing GitHub component discovery system. Users will be able to:
- Connect Figma accounts and browse designs
- Import frames, components, and artboards
- Drag-and-drop designs into chat for animation
- Generate motion graphics from Figma designs

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Phase 1: MVP (Week 1)
- Basic Figma OAuth connection
- File browsing and component indexing
- Simple drag-to-chat functionality
- REST API only implementation

### Phase 2: Enhanced (Week 2)
- Advanced categorization and scoring
- Webhook sync for real-time updates
- Design token extraction
- Motion hint system

### Phase 3: Advanced (Future)
- Figma plugin for in-app tagging
- Dev Mode MCP integration
- Batch import workflows
- Cross-file component libraries

## 🔑 Key Features

### 1. **Smart Component Discovery**
- Automatic detection of UI components (Login, Header, Checkout, etc.)
- Categorization into Auth, Core, Commerce, Interactive, Content
- Scoring based on naming, usage, and structure

### 2. **Visual Preview System**
- Thumbnail generation for all components
- Live preview in panel
- Maintain design fidelity

### 3. **Seamless Animation Workflow**
- Drag design → Drop in chat → Generate animation
- Preserve Figma structure in Remotion code
- Apply motion templates automatically

### 4. **Two Integration Modes**
- **REST API**: Server-side integration for browsing and import
- **Plugin** (optional): In-Figma motion tagging and export

## 🎨 Value Proposition

### For Designers
- Animate designs without coding
- See designs come to life instantly
- Maintain design system consistency

### For Developers
- Skip manual UI recreation
- Import production-ready designs
- Bridge designer-developer gap

### For Bazaar-Vid
- Unique competitive advantage
- Expands addressable market to design teams
- Natural extension of component discovery system

## 📊 Success Metrics

- [ ] Connect to Figma account
- [ ] Browse and index 100+ components
- [ ] Successfully import and animate 10 designs
- [ ] < 5 second import-to-animation time
- [ ] Zero manual code writing required

## 👥 Team Notes

This integration leverages our existing component discovery infrastructure, making it a natural extension rather than a completely new system. The pattern of "discover → categorize → drag → animate" remains consistent.
