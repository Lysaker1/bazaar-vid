# Implementation Roadmap: Figma Integration

## Overview
Three-phase implementation plan to ship Figma integration, starting with MVP in Week 1, enhancements in Week 2, and advanced features in future sprints.

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: MVP (Days 1-5)
**Goal**: Ship basic Figma browsing and import functionality

### Day 1: Foundation Setup
- [ ] Create Figma service structure
  - `src/server/services/figma/figma-discovery.service.ts`
  - `src/server/services/figma/figma-auth.service.ts`
- [ ] Set up Figma OAuth app (or use PAT for testing)
- [ ] Add environment variables
- [ ] Create database tables for Figma connections

### Day 2: API Integration
- [ ] Implement authentication flow (OAuth or PAT)
- [ ] Build file listing endpoints
  - List teams
  - List projects  
  - List files
- [ ] Create tRPC router (`figma.router.ts`)
- [ ] Test API connections

### Day 3: Component Indexing
- [ ] Port categorization logic from GitHub service
- [ ] Implement file structure fetching (shallow mode)
- [ ] Build component detection patterns
- [ ] Create scoring algorithm
- [ ] Generate component catalog

### Day 4: UI Panel
- [ ] Create `FigmaDiscoveryPanel.tsx`
- [ ] Add to panel registry
- [ ] Build file browser UI
- [ ] Display component cards with categories
- [ ] Implement thumbnail fetching

### Day 5: Chat Integration
- [ ] Add drag-and-drop handlers
- [ ] Create Figma drop payload structure
- [ ] Wire up chat message generation
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow
- [ ] Basic Figma-to-Remotion conversion

**Deliverable**: Users can connect Figma, browse files, and drag designs to chat for basic animation

---

## 🎨 Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Days 6-10)
**Goal**: Improve conversion quality and add real-time sync

### Day 6: Advanced Conversion
- [ ] Extract design tokens (colors, typography)
- [ ] Handle complex fills and effects
- [ ] Support vector data (SVG export)
- [ ] Map Figma constraints to CSS

### Day 7: Asset Management
- [ ] Export images from Figma designs
- [ ] Store in R2 with optimization
- [ ] Handle font substitution
- [ ] Create asset reference system

### Day 8: Motion Templates
- [ ] Define motion hint structure
- [ ] Create default animation patterns per category
- [ ] Apply smart animations based on design type
- [ ] Support timing and easing customization

### Day 9: Caching & Performance
- [ ] Implement multi-level cache
  - Memory cache (5 min)
  - Database cache (24 hours)
  - R2 image cache (7 days)
- [ ] Add request throttling
- [ ] Optimize large file handling
- [ ] Background indexing

### Day 10: Webhook Integration
- [ ] Set up Figma webhooks
- [ ] Handle FILE_UPDATE events
- [ ] Auto-refresh component catalog
- [ ] Notify users of design changes

**Deliverable**: High-quality design imports with caching, real-time updates, and smart animations

---

## 🔮 Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future Sprint)
**Goal**: Power features for design teams

### Figma Plugin Development
- [ ] Create Figma plugin scaffold
- [ ] Motion hint tagging system
- [ ] Direct export from Figma UI
- [ ] Batch selection tools
- [ ] Animation preview in Figma

### Component Library Support
- [ ] Track published components
- [ ] Cross-file component references
- [ ] Version management
- [ ] Design system integration

### Dev Mode Integration
- [ ] Connect to Figma Dev Mode MCP
- [ ] Extract component properties
- [ ] Generate typed interfaces
- [ ] Sync with code components

### Advanced Workflows
- [ ] Batch import multiple designs
- [ ] Auto-generate video from file structure
- [ ] Component variant animations
- [ ] Responsive design handling

└── lib/types/
    └── figma.types.ts
```

### Key Milestones

#### Week 1 Checkpoint
- ✅ Users can connect Figma account
- ✅ Browse teams, projects, and files
- ✅ See categorized components
- ✅ Drag to chat creates animation prompt
- ✅ Basic design-to-video conversion works

#### Week 2 Checkpoint  
- ✅ High-fidelity design conversion
- ✅ Cached thumbnails and previews
- ✅ Real-time sync via webhooks
- ✅ Motion templates applied automatically
- ✅ Production-ready performance

### Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Rate limits | Implement caching, request throttling |
| Large files | Shallow fetch, progressive loading |
| Complex designs | Simplification, rasterization fallback |
| Auth complexity | Start with PAT, add OAuth later |
| Conversion quality | Iterate based on real designs |

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### MVP Success (Week 1)
- [ ] 5+ test users connect Figma successfully
- [ ] 100+ components indexed from real files
- [ ] 10+ designs animated successfully
- [ ] < 10 second index time for average file
- [ ] No manual code required

### Full Success (Week 2)
- [ ] 95% design fidelity in conversion
- [ ] Real-time updates working
- [ ] < 2 second drag-to-animate time
- [ ] Support for all major design types
- [ ] Positive user feedback

## 📝 Technical Decisions

### Why REST API First?
- Faster to implement than plugin
- No Figma review process
- Works with all file types
- Server-side control

### Why Reuse GitHub Patterns?
- Proven categorization logic
- Familiar UI/UX for users
- Reduced development time
- Consistent codebase

### Why Phase Approach?
- Ship value quickly (MVP in 1 week)
- Gather feedback early
- Reduce risk
- Allow for iteration
