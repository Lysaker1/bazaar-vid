# Sprint 34: MVP Launch Preparation

**Duration**: January 16-22, 2025  
**Goal**: Fix remaining 3 issues for MVP launch readiness  
**Success Metric**: 100% functional core user workflow

## 🎯 SPRINT OBJECTIVES

Based on user feedback, we're **85% ready for MVP launch**. This sprint focuses on fixing the remaining 3 critical issues rather than building new systems.

### ✅ COMPLETED PRE-SPRINT
- **Projects Dashboard**: Fixed scrolling limitation in GenerateSidebar
- **Cost Control**: Deliberately skipped per user decision ("high usage is good")
- **AWS Export**: Postponed in favor of share links

## 🔥 CRITICAL FIXES (Days 1-3)

### 1. 🔗 Share Functionality Investigation
**Status**: System implemented but user reports issues

**Investigation Tasks**:
- [ ] **Test End-to-End Share Flow**
  - Create share link in UI
  - Verify link generation
  - Test share page rendering
  - Check video playback

- [ ] **Debug Potential Issues**
  - Database schema for sharedVideos table
  - tRPC endpoint responses
  - Share page component rendering
  - Remotion player integration

**Expected Fix Time**: 1-2 days

### 2. 🔧 AutoFix System Debugging  
**Status**: ✅ **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH - State Management Fixed**

**Root Cause Identified**: The autofix system wasn't working because of **state management inconsistencies** across panels. Different panels were using different state update patterns, causing "nothing happens until refresh" issues.

**✅ Implemented Fixes**:
- [x] **Unified State Management**: All panels now use consistent state patterns
- [x] **Cross-Panel Communication**: Added `addSystemMessage()` for automatic chat updates
- [x] **Reactive Updates**: Standardized all panels to use `updateAndRefresh()`
- [x] **Fixed Panel Coordination**: 
  - StoryboardPanelG now uses reactive `updateAndRefresh`
  - PreviewPanelG uses proper Zustand selectors
  - CodePanelG sends system messages when saving scenes
- [x] **Enhanced State Synchronization**: All panels automatically stay in sync

**Expected Impact**: This should fix both the autofix system AND the general "nothing happens until refresh" issues throughout the app.

**Testing Required**: 
- [ ] Test CodePanel save → ChatPanel message flow
- [ ] Verify all panels stay synchronized
- [ ] Test autofix trigger and execution

### 3. 🧠 Main Pipeline Reliability Audit
**Status**: Core tech solid, need edge case testing

**Testing Tasks**:
- [ ] **Image Upload Workflow**
  - Multi-image uploads
  - Image analysis integration
  - Scene generation from images
  - Image-guided editing

- [ ] **Scene Generation Reliability**
  - Various prompt types
  - Complex animations
  - Error handling
  - Recovery mechanisms

- [ ] **State Management Verification**  
  - ✅ Unified state patterns implemented
  - [ ] Test state persistence across sessions
  - [ ] Verify UI consistency under load

**Expected Fix Time**: 1-2 days

## 📋 TESTING & VALIDATION (Days 4-5)

### End-to-End User Journeys
- [ ] **New User Flow**
  - Create project → Add scene → Preview → Share
  - Image upload → Generate scene → Edit → Share
  - Multiple scene project → Full workflow

- [ ] **Power User Flow**
  - Complex project with 5+ scenes
  - Heavy editing and iterations
  - Multiple share links
  - Error recovery scenarios

### Performance & Reliability
- [ ] **Load Testing**
  - Multiple concurrent users
  - Heavy AI usage
  - Large image uploads
  - Complex scene generation

- [ ] **Error Scenario Testing**
  - Network failures
  - AI service timeouts
  - Database connection issues
  - Malformed user inputs

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Must Work Perfectly:
1. **✅ Projects Access** - All projects visible and accessible
2. **🔗 Share Links** - Create, view, and share videos seamlessly  
3. **🔧 AutoFix** - Broken scenes automatically repaired
4. **🧠 Core Pipeline** - Image uploads, generation, editing reliable

### Quality Metrics:
- **0** critical bugs in core workflow
- **<2 second** response time for common operations
- **>95%** success rate for AI operations
- **100%** share link functionality

## 🚀 LAUNCH READINESS CHECKLIST

### Technical Readiness
- [ ] Share functionality verified end-to-end
- [ ] AutoFix system working automatically
- [ ] Main pipeline handles edge cases gracefully
- [ ] No critical bugs in user workflow

### User Experience Readiness  
- [ ] Intuitive project navigation
- [ ] Clear error messages and recovery
- [ ] Smooth sharing experience
- [ ] Responsive UI across devices

### Infrastructure Readiness
- [ ] Database performance optimized
- [ ] AI service reliability verified
- [ ] R2 storage working correctly
- [ ] Authentication flow stable

## 📊 CURRENT STATUS: 85% → 100%

**What's Working Excellently**:
- ✅ Core AI technology (brain orchestrator, tools, models)
- ✅ Admin testing dashboard (world-class)
- ✅ Database architecture (Neon, migrations, auth)
- ✅ UI components (4-panel workspace, state management)
- ✅ Projects access (fixed scrolling)

**What Needs Verification/Fixing**:
- 🔍 Share system (implemented but needs testing)
- 🔍 AutoFix triggering (tool exists but not auto-calling)
- 🔍 Edge case reliability (core works, edge cases unknown)

## 🎯 POST-SPRINT: MVP LAUNCH

**Week of January 23**: Soft launch to limited users  
**Week of January 30**: Public MVP launch  

**Key Insight**: We've built sophisticated AI technology with excellent admin tooling. The remaining work is **verification and polish** of user-facing features, not building new systems.

## 📝 NOTES

- User feedback confirmed our core technology assessment was correct
- Focusing on share links instead of complex AWS export was the right decision
- AutoFix tool is well-built, just needs proper triggering logic
- This is a **polish sprint**, not a development sprint
- Very close to launch-ready state
