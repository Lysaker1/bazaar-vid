  - Precision prompts for surgical edits

### 📊 A/B Testing Framework
- **Systematic testing** of prompt variations against same inputs
- **Performance metrics** tracking: latency, cost, quality, consistency
- **Winner identification** across multiple categories
- **Statistical analysis** of prompt effectiveness

### 💾 Comprehensive Output Saving
- **Detailed test results** saved to organized directories
- **Generated code samples** for manual review
- **Comparison reports** in markdown format
- **Raw performance data** in JSON format

### 🏆 Analysis & Recommendations
- **Automated winner selection** by category (fastest, cheapest, highest quality)
- **Performance insights** and trend analysis
- **Implementation recommendations** with impact assessment
- **Cost-benefit analysis** for prompt changes

## 🎯 Prompt Variations Implemented

## 🚀 Usage Guide

### Basic A/B Testing
```bash
# Test all prompt variations with claude-pack
npm run eval ab-test-prompts claude-pack

# Focus on specific service
npm run eval ab-test-prompts claude-pack --service=brain

# Limit variations and skip baseline
npm run eval ab-test-prompts optimal-pack --max-vars=2 --no-baseline
```

### Advanced Options
```bash
# Full configuration example
npm run eval ab-test-prompts claude-pack \
  --service=addScene \
  --max-vars=3 \
  --no-save

# Available options:
--service=name     # Focus on specific service (brain, addScene, editScene)
--max-vars=N       # Limit number of variations to test
--no-baseline      # Skip baseline prompt testing  
--no-save          # Skip saving detailed outputs
```
