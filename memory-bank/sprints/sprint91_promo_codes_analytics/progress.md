# Sprint 91 Progress - Promo Codes & Advanced Analytics

## 2025-08-02

### Comprehensive Planning & Architecture Complete ✓

Based on flight brainstorming session, created extensive documentation and system designs for:

#### 1. Promo Code System ✓
- **Migration Status**: Created but not yet pushed to dev/prod
- **Testing Plan**: Complete 5-phase testing strategy documented
- **Features Planned**:
  - Multiple discount types (percentage, fixed, free)
  - Usage limits and expiration dates
  - One-per-user enforcement
  - Admin management interface
  - Analytics tracking

#### 2. Multi-Context Tool Decision System ✓
**Revolutionary change to Brain orchestrator:**
- Enables multiple tool executions from single prompt
- Parallel and sequential operation support
- Context sharing between tools
- Progressive UI with bullet points (like Claude Code)
- Example: "Make all scenes faster" → Edits all scenes in parallel
- Complete architecture documented with code examples

#### 3. Claude Code Agents Created ✓
Successfully created three new specialized agents:

**UI Consistency Agent** (`ui-consistency.md`):
- Analyzes components for style consistency
- Checks state management patterns
- Identifies performance issues
- Provides consistency scores and quick wins

**Implications Analyzer Agent** (`implications-analyzer.md`):
- Identifies hidden complexity in proposed features
- Detects technical debt risks
- Suggests simpler alternatives
- Reality checks assumptions
- Example: "Real-time collab" → Reveals need for CRDT, conflict resolution, etc.

**Trends Researcher Agent** (`trends-researcher.md`):
- Monitors emerging technologies
- Evaluates modern alternatives
- Provides migration paths
- Includes adoption metrics and trade-offs

#### 4. Admin Intelligence Layer ✓
Designed comprehensive admin interface improvements:
- **Natural Language SQL**: Ask questions in English, get SQL results
- **Project Search**: Direct search by UUID
- **Intelligent Insights**: Automated anomaly detection
- **Promo Analytics Dashboard**: Usage trends, conversion metrics
- **Security**: Query sanitization, read-only access

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### Multi-Tool Execution Flow
```
User Prompt → Brain Analysis → Multiple Tool Decisions → 
Parallel/Sequential Execution → Progressive UI Updates → 
Context Sharing → Completion
```

#### Context Management System
- Global context (style, tone, brand)
- Scene-specific context
- Web research integration
- Persistent across tool executions

#### UI Progress Pattern
```
• Gathering context... (in progress)
• Creating scene 1... (waiting)
• Creating scene 2... (waiting)
• Applying effects... (waiting)
```

### Technical Specifications Created

1. **ExecutionPlan Interface**: Defines multi-tool operations
2. **ContextManager System**: Handles context persistence
3. **ProgressUI Components**: Real-time status updates
4. **NaturalLanguageSQL Engine**: Query conversion and validation
5. **PromoCodeAnalytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive metrics

### Implementation Priorities

**Immediate (Week 1)**:
1. Push promo code migrations to dev
2. Test promo code functionality
3. Start multi-tool backend implementation

**Short-term (Week 2)**:
4. Context gathering tool
5. Progressive UI system
6. Basic admin search

**Medium-term (Weeks 3-4)**:
7. Natural language SQL
8. Analytics dashboards
9. Intelligence layer

### Risk Mitigation

**Identified Risks**:
- Migration failures → Backup strategy documented
- Parallel execution overload → Rate limiting planned
- Context conflicts → Versioning system designed
- UI complexity → Progressive disclosure approach

### Next Actions

1. **Apply promo code migration to dev database**
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

2. **Test promo code creation and usage**

3. **Begin implementing multi-tool decision engine**

4. **Create prototype of progress UI component**

## Summary

Sprint 91 successfully planned and architected major system improvements based on user insights. Created comprehensive documentation for promo codes, multi-context tools, intelligent admin interface, and three new Claude Code agents. Ready to begin implementation phase with clear priorities and risk mitigation strategies.
