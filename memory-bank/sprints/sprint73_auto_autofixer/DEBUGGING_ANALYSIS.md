# Sprint 73: Auto-Fix Debugging Analysis

## Current Status: Silent Auto-Fix NOT Working

### Evidence:
1. **No [SILENT FIX] logs** in console output
2. Fix messages still being sent through normal chat flow
3. Same prompt being used repeatedly (not progressive)
4. More than 3 attempts (no limit enforcement)

### Issues Found:

#### 1. Strange "x" Prefix Bug
The AI generated code starting with `x`:
```javascript
x
const script_md565alj = [
```
This caused "Variable 'x' is not defined" error.

**Fixed**: Added code to remove "x" prefix in CodeGeneratorNEW.ts

#### 2. Silent Auto-Fix Not Running
Despite:
- Hook being called in ChatPanelG
- Event listeners set up
- Debug logging enabled

We see NO [SILENT FIX] logs, meaning the system isn't receiving events.

### Possible Causes:

1. **Old System Still Active Somewhere**
   - Fix messages are being sent through generateScene
   - Must be another component listening and sending fixes

2. **Event Not Being Dispatched Correctly**
   - PreviewPanelG dispatches 'preview-scene-error'
   - But our hook might not be receiving it

3. **Hook Not Initialized Properly**
   - useAutoFix is called but might not be working
   - Could be a React rendering issue

### Next Steps:

1. Add more debug logging to track initialization
2. Find where old auto-fix messages are coming from
3. Verify event dispatch/listener connection
4. Check if there's a server-side auto-fix system

### The Mystery:
Someone/something is sending "ðŸ”§ FIX BROKEN SCENE" messages through the normal chat API, but it's not our new silent system. We need to find this old implementation and disable it.
