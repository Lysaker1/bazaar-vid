# Sprint 73: Debugging Update

## Latest Status

### Completed Actions:
1. **Enhanced Prompts** - Added explicit warnings at the top of all generation prompts:
   - code-generator.ts
   - code-editor.ts  
   - typography-generator.ts
   - image-recreator.ts
   
   All now have this warning:
   ```
   ðŸš¨ CRITICAL VARIABLE NAMING RULE:
   NEVER use 'currentFrame' as a variable name. The Remotion hook is called 'useCurrentFrame', not 'currentFrame'.
   ALWAYS use: const frame = useCurrentFrame();
   NEVER use: const currentFrame = useCurrentFrame(); // This causes "Identifier already declared" error
   ```

2. **Added Debug Logging** - Enhanced use-auto-fix.ts with:
   - Timestamp logging
   - Event test to verify event system works
   - Detailed event reception logging
   - Queue state tracking

3. **Fixed "x" Prefix Bug** - Already fixed in CodeGeneratorNEW.ts

### Current Issues:

1. **Silent Auto-Fix Not Running**
   - No [SILENT FIX] logs in console despite event listeners being set up
   - PreviewPanelG IS dispatching 'preview-scene-error' events correctly
   - useAutoFix hook IS being called in ChatPanelG
   - But the events don't seem to be reaching the listener

2. **Old Auto-Fix Still Active**
   - "ðŸ”§ FIX BROKEN SCENE" messages still being sent through normal chat flow
   - These are coming from user typing them directly, not from our system
   - They go through generateScene â†’ brain orchestrator â†’ editScene tool

3. **currentFrame Issue**
   - Despite prompt updates, AI still sometimes generates wrong pattern
   - May need more aggressive prompt engineering or post-processing

### Next Steps:

1. **Debug Event Connection**
   - The enhanced logging should show if events are being received
   - Check if there's a timing issue (hook mounting after errors occur)
   - Verify PreviewPanelG and ChatPanelG are in same window context

2. **Consider Alternative Approach**
   - Instead of events, could pass error state directly through props
   - Or use a shared Zustand store for error tracking

3. **Post-Process Generated Code**
   - Add a step in code generation to automatically fix common patterns
   - Replace any `const currentFrame = useCurrentFrame()` with `const frame = useCurrentFrame()`

### Key Insight:
The problem isn't that there's another auto-fix system - it's that users are manually sending fix prompts that look like our auto-fix prompts. The silent system isn't working because the events aren't connecting properly between PreviewPanelG and the useAutoFix hook.
