# Sprint 25 Progress

## May 24, 2025
- **BAZAAR-260: Test Suite Scaffolding for ESM Migration:**
  - **Server-side Test Updates:** Enhanced `src/server/workers/__tests__/buildComponent.test.ts` by adding a new test suite for ESM output verification. This includes tests for dynamic `import()`, ensuring `module.default` export, and checking for correctly externalized dependencies (`react`, `remotion`, etc.). Addressed several TypeScript lint errors related to mock typings to improve test file robustness.
  - **Client-side Test Placeholders:**
    - Confirmed that `src/hooks/__tests__/useRemoteComponent.test.tsx` already exists. This file will be populated later with React Testing Library tests for `React.lazy`, `<Suspense>`, and error boundaries as per the BAZAAR-260 plan.
    - Created `src/remotion/components/scenes/__tests__/CustomScene.test.tsx` with `it.todo` placeholders for future tests covering loading states, error handling, and refresh mechanisms with React Testing Library.
  - This work establishes the foundational structure for testing the ESM migration as outlined in `BAZAAR-260-testing-verification-updates.md`.

## May 23, 2025
- **Comprehensive Documentation Update for ESM Migration Tickets:**
  - Completed a thorough review and update of the markdown files for BAZAAR tickets 255, 256, 257, and 258.
  - **Integration of Code Analysis:** Each ticket's documentation now includes specific findings from our direct code review of relevant files (e.g., `buildCustomComponent.ts`, `useRemoteComponent.tsx`, `CustomScene.tsx`).
  - **Cross-Referencing:** Enhanced the documents by linking findings and proposals to the broader ESM migration strategy outlined in `overview.md` and the Remotion-specific guidance in `esm-lazy.md`.
  - **Clarity on Current State vs. Proposed Changes:** The updates provide a clearer delineation between the current IIFE/global-based implementation and the proposed ESM/React.lazy-based solutions.
  - **Detailed Interdependencies:** The documentation now better highlights how BAZAAR-255 (ESM Build Pipeline) is a critical blocker for BAZAAR-256 (Component Loading), which in turn impacts BAZAAR-257 (Component Templates) and BAZAAR-258 (Runtime Dependencies).
  - This detailed documentation aims to provide a solid foundation for the subsequent implementation phases of the ESM migration.

## May 20, 2025
- Created comprehensive documentation files for all key BAZAAR tickets:
  - `BAZAAR-255-ESM-build-pipeline.md`: Detailed analysis of switching from IIFE to ESM format, global name wrapper removal, and external dependency configuration.
  - `BAZAAR-256-component-loading.md`: Detailed plan for replacing script tag injection with React.lazy(), implementing Suspense boundaries, and URL parameter-based refreshing.
  - `BAZAAR-257-component-templates.md`: Documentation for updating component templates to use proper export default syntax and standard ESM imports.
  - `BAZAAR-258-runtime-dependencies.md`: Analysis of import maps vs bundling strategies for runtime dependencies, with version compatibility considerations.
- Each document includes current implementation details, proposed changes, potential effects, implementation considerations, and testing strategies.

## May 20, 2025 (Evening Update)

- **BAZAAR-255 Analysis (`src/server/workers/buildCustomComponent.ts`):**
    - Verified that the esbuild configuration in `compileWithEsbuild` still uses `format: 'iife'`, not `esm`.
    - Confirmed that `wrapTsxWithGlobals` is still in use and responsible for registering components to `window.__REMOTION_COMPONENT`.
    - The proposal to switch to ESM and remove global component registration (Proposed Changes #1 and #2 in `BAZAAR-255-ESM-build-pipeline.md`) is **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**.
    - React and Remotion are marked as external (Proposed Change #3), but this could be expanded (e.g., `react-dom`, `@remotion/*`).
    - R2 Upload `ContentType` is correctly set to `application/javascript`.
    - Server-side build verification using dynamic `import()` for ESM is not implemented (as the output is not ESM).
    - This indicates that the core objectives of BAZAAR-255 regarding ESM migration are outstanding.

## BAZAAR-256: Modernize Component Loading Mechanism

**Analysis Date:** May 21, 2025

**Objective:** Review the proposed changes in BAZAAR-256 to modernize the component loading mechanism, primarily by replacing script tag injection with `React.lazy()` and `<Suspense>`, and compare this with the current codebase.

**Findings:**

1.  **`useRemoteComponent.tsx` Implementation (`src/hooks/useRemoteComponent.tsx`):
    *   The current implementation aligns perfectly with the "Current Implementation" described in the BAZAAR-256 ticket.
    *   **Mechanism:** It fetches component code as text, then injects this code into a dynamically created `<script>` tag (`script.textContent = fetchedCode`). This script is then appended to the DOM to execute.
    *   **Global Reliance:** It critically relies on the executed script setting `window.__REMOTION_COMPONENT`. The hook then reads this global variable to get the component. It even includes a fallback to search for other potential component functions in the global scope if `window.__REMOTION_COMPONENT` is not found.
    *   **State Management:** Manages `loading`, `error`, and `retry` states manually using `useState` and `setTimeout`.
    *   **Cleanup/Refresh:** Involves direct DOM manipulation to remove old script tags and explicitly clears `window.__REMOTION_COMPONENT`.
    *   **Cache Busting:** Uses URL parameters (`timestamp`, `retryCount`) for the initial `fetch` call.

2.  **Blocker from BAZAAR-255:**
    *   The core proposal of BAZAAR-256 (using `React.lazy(() => import(url))`) is entirely dependent on the successful completion of BAZAAR-255 (migrating the build pipeline to output ESM modules).
    *   Since components are currently built as IIFEs that pollute the global namespace (as determined in BAZAAR-255 analysis), `React.lazy` cannot be used as it expects the imported URL to provide a standard ES module.

3.  **Relevance of BAZAAR-256 Proposals:**
    *   The changes proposed in BAZAAR-256 (using `React.lazy`, `<Suspense>`, and a more React-idiomatic refresh mechanism) are highly desirable and would resolve the issues inherent in the current script-injection/global-variable approach (namespace pollution, race conditions, complex manual state management).

**Conclusion for BAZAAR-256:**

The current component loading mechanism implemented in `useRemoteComponent.tsx` is a classic script-injection pattern that relies on global variables. While it includes robustness features like retries and fallbacks, it suffers from the problems BAZAAR-256 aims to solve.

**The implementation of BAZAAR-256 is currently BLOCKED by the incomplete status of BAZAAR-255.** Once the build pipeline consistently outputs ESM modules, the `useRemoteComponent` hook can be refactored as per the BAZAAR-256 proposals.

**Next Steps related to BAZAAR-256 Analysis:**
*   Examine `CustomScene.tsx` to understand how `useRemoteComponent` is consumed and how its loading/error states are handled in the UI.

**Update (May 22, 2025): Analysis of `CustomScene.tsx` (`src/remotion/components/scenes/CustomScene.tsx`)**

*   **Consumer of `useRemoteComponent`:** `CustomScene.tsx` imports `useRemoteComponent` (aliased as `RemoteComponent`) and uses it to render the dynamic components.
*   **Props Passed:** It passes `scriptSrc` (the R2 URL) and `databaseId` to `RemoteComponent` as expected.
*   **Manual Loading/Error States:** `CustomScene.tsx` manages its own loading and error states, primarily for fetching antecedent data (Animation Design Brief - ADB) *before* the `RemoteComponent` itself loads the component script. The `RemoteComponent` then has its own internal loading/error handling for the script.
    *   This aligns with the observation that BAZAAR-256's proposal for `<Suspense>` would simplify error/loading state management for the component script itself.
*   **Manual Refresh Mechanism:** `CustomScene.tsx` implements a refresh mechanism by accepting an `externalRefreshToken` prop. This token is used to generate a `refreshKey`, which is then supplied as the `key` prop to the `<RemoteComponent />`. When this `key` changes, React unmounts and remounts the component, forcing `useRemoteComponent` to re-execute and reload.
    *   This is a manual implementation of the refresh concept. BAZAAR-256's proposal to use URL parameters with `React.lazy` would integrate this more cleanly within `useRemoteComponent`.
*   **Dependency on BAZAAR-255:** Improvements in `CustomScene.tsx` based on BAZAAR-256 proposals (like using `<Suspense>` around a lazy-loaded component) are also contingent on `useRemoteComponent` being refactored, which in turn depends on BAZAAR-255 (ESM builds).

**Overall Blocker:** The critical path is: Implement BAZAAR-255 (ESM builds) → Implement BAZAAR-256 (React.lazy in `useRemoteComponent`) → Refactor `CustomScene` for Suspense.
