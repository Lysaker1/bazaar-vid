# Sprint 25 Progress

Sprint 25 focuses on improvements to custom components, with a particular emphasis on adopting ESM (ECMAScript Modules) to replace the current IIFE approach.

## May 20, 2025: Kickoff Meeting

- Reviewed component issues from Sprint 20 retrospective
- Mapped out 9 BAZAAR tickets for custom component improvements
- Main focus on ESM migration, component loading, and testing
- Divided work into frontend and backend tasks
- Set development environment for component testing

## May 21, 2025: BAZAAR-255 ESM Build Pipeline Investigation

- Analyzed current build pipeline in `buildCustomComponent.ts`
- Tested esbuild configuration with `format: 'esm'`
- Created examples of ESM output versus current IIFE output
- Researched best practices for React component ESM bundling
- Preliminary tests show expected size and performance improvements

## May 22, 2025: BAZAAR-256 React.lazy Loading Implementation

- Started work on React.lazy implementation in CustomScene.tsx
- Researched Suspense and error boundary usage
- Created POC for dynamic ESM component imports
- Identified challenges with caching and component updates
- Documented differences between direct script loading and React.lazy

## May 23, 2025: BAZAAR-257 Component Template Updates

- Updated component templates to use ESM format
- Created tests for default and named export patterns
- Removed global registration code from templates
- Added JSDoc documentation to template code
- Created examples for component developers

## May 24, 2025: BAZAAR-258 Runtime Dependencies Analysis

- Listed common runtime dependencies across components
- Researched import maps for dependency resolution
- Created strategy for handling shared dependencies
- Tested import map configurations in development
- Analyzed browser compatibility considerations

## May 25, 2025: BAZAAR-259 Server-Side Validation

- Started work on server-side component validation
- Researched approaches to pre-validate components
- Created plan for server-side rendering tests
- Analyzed error patterns in current component issues
- Designed validation pipeline for component deployment

## May 26, 2025: BAZAAR-260 Testing Updates

- Created test cases for ESM component loading
- Updated existing tests to work with new ESM format
- Added performance benchmarks for component loading
- Created fixtures for component testing
- Added tests for different component export patterns (default export, named export)
- Tested external dependency handling

## May 26, 2025: BAZAAR-261 Documentation Updates
- Created `esm-component-development.md` as a developer guide for writing ESM-compatible components.
- Updated `custom-components-guide.md` to remove legacy global usage and show the new ESM pattern.
- Updated API documentation (`custom-components-integration.md`) with details on React.lazy loading of ESM modules.

## May 26, 2025: BAZAAR-263 Shared Module System Implemented
- Added a lightweight registry under `src/shared/modules`.
- Modules can be registered and retrieved by name with version tracking.
- Documented usage in `BAZAAR-263-shared-modules.md`.

## Component Harness Implementation

- (2024-06-04) Implemented ESM + lazy loading patterns in the Component Test Harness
  - Added import maps for proper dependency resolution
  - Replaced global component registration with proper ESM module loading
  - Implemented clean resource management for blob URLs
  - Added fallback mechanism for components without default exports
  - Documented implementation details in `memory-bank/testing/component-testing/esm-lazy-implementation.md`
  - Fixed React.lazy implementation that was causing promise resolution errors

## ESM + Lazy Loading Implementation

### Component Harness

✅ Implemented ESM + lazy loading for the component test harness
- Created proper import map for ESM dependency resolution
- Implemented dynamic ES module loading
- Added resource cleanup for blob URLs
- Implemented proper error handling

✅ Fixed Remotion version conflict
- Updated import map to use consistent Remotion version (4.0.290)
- Eliminated version conflict between different parts of the application
- Ensured proper module loading without version-related errors

### Import Map Components

- [ ] Implement import map in main application

### Component Registry

- [ ] Create ESM component registry
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for production components

### Testing & Validation

- [ ] Write tests for ESM component loading
- [ ] Validate performance of lazy loaded components

## ESM Build Pipeline

### Webpack Configuration

- [ ] Update Webpack configuration for ESM output
- [ ] Configure proper externals for ESM dependencies

### Build Process

- [ ] Implement ESM build step for components
- [ ] Configure proper export handling

## May 21, 2025 - Addressing Component Harness Errors

* **Investigated `react/jsx-dev-runtime` error:** After integrating Sucrase, the component harness threw an error "Failed to resolve module specifier 'react/jsx-dev-runtime'". This was due to Sucrase's `jsxRuntime: 'automatic'` option generating an import statement that couldn't be resolved from a Blob URL.
* **Applied Fix:** Modified `src/app/test/component-harness/page.tsx` to set `jsxRuntime: 'classic'` in Sucrase's transform options. This changes the output to `React.createElement(...)`, which should work as `React` is in scope for the dynamic component. This is a direct attempt to resolve issues noted in BAZAAR-256.
* **Next Step:** Awaiting user confirmation that this resolves the error and allows dynamic components to load correctly.
