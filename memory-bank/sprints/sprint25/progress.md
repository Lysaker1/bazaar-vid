# Sprint 25 Progress

## May 25, 2025: BAZAAR-255 ESM Build Pipeline Migration Implemented

The first ticket in the ESM migration, BAZAAR-255, has been implemented. This change modernizes the component build pipeline to output ESM modules instead of IIFE bundles. Key changes include:

1. Updated `buildCustomComponent.ts` to use `format: 'esm'` instead of `format: 'iife'`
2. Removed `globalName: 'COMPONENT_BUNDLE'` option from the esbuild configuration
3. Updated the external dependencies list to include `['react', 'react-dom', 'remotion', '@remotion/*']`
4. Removed the global wrapping logic (`wrapTsxWithGlobals` function) that was injecting window.__REMOTION_COMPONENT
5. Modified `sanitizeTsx` to preserve React and Remotion imports for ESM compatibility
6. Added proper detection and handling of default exports to ensure React.lazy compatibility
7. Fixed TypeScript type issues with the buildLogger methods

This change forms the foundation for the next tickets in the ESM migration. The build pipeline now produces standard ES modules that can be loaded with React.lazy.

Next steps:
- Test the ESM output with actual components
- Implement BAZAAR-256 to update the component loading mechanism with React.lazy
- Update component templates for ESM format (BAZAAR-257)

## May 24, 2025: Sprint Planning Complete

Completed planning for Sprint 25. The complete implementation sequence has been mapped out in detailed tickets, and we've analyzed the codebase for the necessary changes. The plan includes:

1. Update build pipeline to output ESM modules
2. Update component loader to use React.lazy instead of script tag injection
3. Modernize component templates for ESM compatibility
4. Handle runtime dependencies through import maps or bundling

## May 24, 2025
- **BAZAAR-260: Test Suite Scaffolding for ESM Migration:**
  - **Server-side Test Updates:** Enhanced `src/server/workers/__tests__/buildComponent.test.ts` by adding a new test suite for ESM output verification. This includes tests for dynamic `import()`, ensuring `module.default` export, and checking for correctly externalized dependencies (`react`, `remotion`, etc.). Addressed several TypeScript lint errors related to mock typings to improve test file robustness.
  - **Client-side Test Placeholders:**
    - Confirmed that `src/hooks/__tests__/useRemoteComponent.test.tsx` already exists. This file will be populated later with React Testing Library tests for `React.lazy`, `<Suspense>`, and error boundaries as per the BAZAAR-260 plan.
    - Created `src/remotion/components/scenes/__tests__/CustomScene.test.tsx` with `it.todo` placeholders for future tests covering loading states, error handling, and refresh mechanisms with React Testing Library.
  - This work establishes the foundational structure for testing the ESM migration as outlined in `BAZAAR-260-testing-verification-updates.md`.

## May 25, 2025
- **BAZAAR-260: Documentation & Checklist Updates**
  - Marked build verification tests as complete in `BAZAAR-260-testing-verification-updates.md`.
  - Expanded `esm-component-testing.md` with explicit commands for running tests, type checking, and linting.
  - Updated sprint TODO to reflect progress on BAZAAR-260.

## May 23, 2025
- **Comprehensive Documentation Update for ESM Migration Tickets:**
  - Completed a thorough review and update of the markdown files for BAZAAR tickets 255, 256, 257, and 258.
  - **Integration of Code Analysis:** Each ticket's documentation now includes specific findings from our direct code review of relevant files (e.g., `buildCustomComponent.ts`, `useRemoteComponent.tsx`, `CustomScene.tsx`).
  - **Cross-Referencing:** Enhanced the documents by linking findings and proposals to the broader ESM migration strategy outlined in `overview.md` and the Remotion-specific guidance in `esm-lazy.md`.
  - **Clarity on Current State vs. Proposed Changes:** The updates provide a clearer delineation between the current IIFE/global-based implementation and the proposed ESM/React.lazy-based solutions.
  - **Detailed Interdependencies:** The documentation now better highlights how BAZAAR-255 (ESM Build Pipeline) is a critical blocker for BAZAAR-256 (Component Loading), which in turn impacts BAZAAR-257 (Component Templates) and BAZAAR-258 (Runtime Dependencies).
  - This detailed documentation aims to provide a solid foundation for the subsequent implementation phases of the ESM migration.

## May 20, 2025
- Created comprehensive documentation files for all key BAZAAR tickets:
  - `BAZAAR-255-ESM-build-pipeline.md`: Detailed analysis of switching from IIFE to ESM format, global name wrapper removal, and external dependency configuration.
  - `BAZAAR-256-component-loading.md`: Detailed plan for replacing script tag injection with React.lazy(), implementing Suspense boundaries, and URL parameter-based refreshing.
  - `BAZAAR-257-component-templates.md`: Documentation for updating component templates to use proper export default syntax and standard ESM imports.
  - `BAZAAR-258-runtime-dependencies.md`: Analysis of import maps vs bundling strategies for runtime dependencies, with version compatibility considerations.
- Each document includes current implementation details, proposed changes, potential effects, implementation considerations, and testing strategies.

## May 20, 2025 (Evening Update)

- **BAZAAR-255 Analysis (`src/server/workers/buildCustomComponent.ts`):**
    - Verified that the esbuild configuration in `compileWithEsbuild` still uses `format: 'iife'`, not `esm`.
    - Confirmed that `wrapTsxWithGlobals` is still in use and responsible for registering components to `window.__REMOTION_COMPONENT`.
    - The proposal to switch to ESM and remove global component registration (Proposed Changes #1 and #2 in `BAZAAR-255-ESM-build-pipeline.md`) is **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**.
    - React and Remotion are marked as external (Proposed Change #3), but this could be expanded (e.g., `react-dom`, `@remotion/*`).
    - R2 Upload `ContentType` is correctly set to `application/javascript`.
    - Server-side build verification using dynamic `import()` for ESM is not implemented (as the output is not ESM).
    - This indicates that the core objectives of BAZAAR-255 regarding ESM migration are outstanding.

## BAZAAR-256: Modernize Component Loading Mechanism

**Analysis Date:** May 21, 2025

**Objective:** Review the proposed changes in BAZAAR-256 to modernize the component loading mechanism, primarily by replacing script tag injection with `React.lazy()` and `<Suspense>`, and compare this with the current codebase.

**Findings:**

1.  **`useRemoteComponent.tsx` Implementation (`src/hooks/useRemoteComponent.tsx`):
    *   The current implementation aligns perfectly with the "Current Implementation" described in the BAZAAR-256 ticket.
    *   **Mechanism:** It fetches component code as text, then injects this code into a dynamically created `<script>` tag (`script.textContent = fetchedCode`). This script is then appended to the DOM to execute.
    *   **Global Reliance:** It critically relies on the executed script setting `window.__REMOTION_COMPONENT`. The hook then reads this global variable to get the component. It even includes a fallback to search for other potential component functions in the global scope if `window.__REMOTION_COMPONENT` is not found.
    *   **State Management:** Manages `loading`, `error`, and `retry` states manually using `useState` and `setTimeout`.
    *   **Cleanup/Refresh:** Involves direct DOM manipulation to remove old script tags and explicitly clears `window.__REMOTION_COMPONENT`.
    *   **Cache Busting:** Uses URL parameters (`timestamp`, `retryCount`) for the initial `fetch` call.

2.  **Blocker from BAZAAR-255:**
    *   The core proposal of BAZAAR-256 (using `React.lazy(() => import(url))`) is entirely dependent on the successful completion of BAZAAR-255 (migrating the build pipeline to output ESM modules).
    *   Since components are currently built as IIFEs that pollute the global namespace (as determined in BAZAAR-255 analysis), `React.lazy` cannot be used as it expects the imported URL to provide a standard ES module.

3.  **Relevance of BAZAAR-256 Proposals:**
    *   The changes proposed in BAZAAR-256 (using `React.lazy`, `<Suspense>`, and a more React-idiomatic refresh mechanism) are highly desirable and would resolve the issues inherent in the current script-injection/global-variable approach (namespace pollution, race conditions, complex manual state management).

**Conclusion for BAZAAR-256:**

The current component loading mechanism implemented in `useRemoteComponent.tsx` is a classic script-injection pattern that relies on global variables. While it includes robustness features like retries and fallbacks, it suffers from the problems BAZAAR-256 aims to solve.

**The implementation of BAZAAR-256 is currently BLOCKED by the incomplete status of BAZAAR-255.** Once the build pipeline consistently outputs ESM modules, the `useRemoteComponent` hook can be refactored as per the BAZAAR-256 proposals.

**Next Steps related to BAZAAR-256 Analysis:**
*   Examine `CustomScene.tsx` to understand how `useRemoteComponent` is consumed and how its loading/error states are handled in the UI.

**Update (May 22, 2025): Analysis of `CustomScene.tsx` (`src/remotion/components/scenes/CustomScene.tsx`)**

*   **Consumer of `useRemoteComponent`:** `CustomScene.tsx` imports `useRemoteComponent` (aliased as `RemoteComponent`) and uses it to render the dynamic components.
*   **Props Passed:** It passes `scriptSrc` (the R2 URL) and `databaseId` to `RemoteComponent` as expected.
*   **Manual Loading/Error States:** `CustomScene.tsx` manages its own loading and error states, primarily for fetching antecedent data (Animation Design Brief - ADB) *before* the `RemoteComponent` itself loads the component script. The `RemoteComponent` then has its own internal loading/error handling for the script.
    *   This aligns with the observation that BAZAAR-256's proposal for `<Suspense>` would simplify error/loading state management for the component script itself.
*   **Manual Refresh Mechanism:** `CustomScene.tsx` implements a refresh mechanism by accepting an `externalRefreshToken` prop. This token is used to generate a `refreshKey`, which is then supplied as the `key` prop to the `<RemoteComponent />`. When this `key` changes, React unmounts and remounts the component, forcing `useRemoteComponent` to re-execute and reload.
    *   This is a manual implementation of the refresh concept. BAZAAR-256's proposal to use URL parameters with `React.lazy` would integrate this more cleanly within `useRemoteComponent`.
*   **Dependency on BAZAAR-255:** Improvements in `CustomScene.tsx` based on BAZAAR-256 proposals (like using `<Suspense>` around a lazy-loaded component) are also contingent on `useRemoteComponent` being refactored, which in turn depends on BAZAAR-255 (ESM builds).

**Overall Blocker:** The critical path is: Implement BAZAAR-255 (ESM builds) → Implement BAZAAR-256 (React.lazy in `useRemoteComponent`) → Refactor `CustomScene` for Suspense.
