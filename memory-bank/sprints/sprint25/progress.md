# Sprint 25 Progress

## 2024-07-30: Component Test Harness ESM Loading Fixed

Successfully resolved all issues with the Component Test Harness for dynamically loading ESM components:

1. **Fixed React Duplication**: Identified and resolved the root cause of React context errors - the system was loading two separate React instances (Next.js bundle and ESM import map). Fixed by:
   - Removing React/ReactDOM from the import map
   - Replacing `import React` statements in transpiled code with `const React = window.React`
   - Ensuring the dynamic component uses the host's React instance

2. **Corrected Remotion Player Integration**:
   - Changed from `component` to `lazyComponent` prop on the Player component
   - Fixed module resolution pattern to match Remotion's expectations
   - Added proper error handling for component loading failures

3. **Simplified Component Loading Approach**:
   - Streamlined the dynamic import process
   - Removed unnecessary wrapping layers
   - Improved code organization and error handling

With these changes, the Component Test Harness now successfully loads and renders dynamically compiled components with proper React context and hooks support. This implementation serves as a reference for the broader ESM component loading architecture in the main application.

## 2025-05-21: ESM Component Loading Implementation Refined

Further improved the ESM component loading implementation in the Component Test Harness:

1. **Preserved User Component Logic**: Instead of replacing user components with a hardcoded component:
   - Now keeping the original component code structure and logic
   - Properly transforming React and Remotion imports to use the host instances
   - Adding default exports only when needed (if not already present)

2. **Improved Global Access Pattern**:
   - Exposed both React and Remotion as window globals for consistent access
   - Made the shared module registry directly available to component code
   - Pre-extracted common Remotion utilities for simpler component access

3. **Enhanced Module Bootstrapping**:
   - Improved RegExp patterns for more robust import transformation
   - Added shared utilities access with proper global fallbacks
   - Implemented a cleaner pattern for checking existing default exports

This refined implementation provides a more robust solution for ESM component loading that works seamlessly with Remotion's Player component while maintaining proper React context and preventing duplicate library instances.

Sprint 25 focuses on improvements to custom components, with a particular emphasis on adopting ESM (ECMAScript Modules) to replace the current IIFE approach.

## May 21, 2025 - Component Harness Improvements

* **Investigated `react/jsx-dev-runtime` error:** After integrating Sucrase, the component harness threw an error "Failed to resolve module specifier 'react/jsx-dev-runtime'". This was due to Sucrase's `jsxRuntime: 'automatic'` option generating an import statement that couldn't be resolved from a Blob URL.
* **Applied Fix:** Modified `src/app/test/component-harness/page.tsx` to set `jsxRuntime: 'classic'` in Sucrase's transform options. This changes the output to `React.createElement(...)`, which should work as `React` is in scope for the dynamic component.
* **Resolved context errors:** Fixed "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')" by properly implementing React.lazy and ensuring the component is rendered within the correct Remotion context hierarchy.
* **Eliminated hydration errors:** Moved random ID generation to client-side effects using refs instead of state to prevent hydration mismatches.
* **Implemented React.lazy pattern:** Refactored the component harness to use proper React.lazy for dynamic module loading, aligning with Sprint 25's ESM approach and demonstrating the pattern working in practice.
* **Added robust error handling:** Added proper error boundaries and suspense fallbacks for a better testing experience.
* **Integrated shared module system:** Connected the component harness with the shared module registry for testing component interaction with shared utilities.

These improvements make the component harness a valuable tool for validating Sprint 25's ESM improvements and provide a working reference implementation of the key BAZAAR-256 changes.
