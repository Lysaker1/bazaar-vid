# Redirect Logic Fix Implementation

**Date**: January 2, 2025  
**Sprint**: 65  
**Branch**: Wed/2 (with modifications)

## Problem Statement
Authenticated users couldn't access the landing page due to automatic redirect loop:
- Landing page → redirects to /projects/new
- Logo click → goes to / → redirects again
- Users trapped in workspace with no way to see marketing content

## Solution Implemented
Enhanced the middleware approach from Wed/2 branch with query parameter bypass.

### Changes Made:

1. **Modified middleware.ts**
   ```typescript
   // Check if user explicitly wants to view landing page
   const intentionalLanding = searchParams.has('view') || searchParams.has('landing');
   
   // Only redirect authenticated users from homepage if not intentional
   if (pathname === '/' && !intentionalLanding) {
     return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/projects/new', req.url));
   }
   ```

2. **Updated AppHeader.tsx**
   ```html
   <a href="/?view" className="flex items-center" aria-label="Go to homepage">
   ```

3. **Updated MobileAppHeader.tsx**
   ```html
   <a href="/?view" className="flex items-center" aria-label="Go to homepage">
   ```

## How It Works
- **Default behavior**: Authenticated users visiting `/` are redirected to `/projects/new`
- **Logo click**: Takes users to `/?view` which bypasses the redirect
- **Direct visits**: Users can manually navigate to `/?view` or `/?landing` to see the marketing page
- **Clean URLs**: Query parameter is minimal and self-descriptive

## Benefits
1. ✅ Eliminates the redirect loop
2. ✅ Users can access landing page when needed
3. ✅ Maintains auto-redirect convenience for direct visits
4. ✅ Server-side redirect (no flash)
5. ✅ Simple implementation
6. ✅ Works on both desktop and mobile

## Alternative Approaches Considered
1. **Referer-based logic**: Unreliable, depends on browser headers
2. **Session storage**: Requires client-side JavaScript
3. **Remove auto-redirect**: Loses convenience
4. **Separate marketing route**: Changes URL structure

## Testing
1. Visit `/` as authenticated user → Should redirect to `/projects/new`
2. Click logo from project page → Should go to `/?view` and show landing page
3. Direct visit to `/?view` → Should show landing page
4. Visit `/` as unauthenticated user → Should show landing page normally

## Future Considerations
- Could add a "View Landing Page" link in user dropdown menu
- Could use `/?marketing` or `/?home` instead of `/?view` if preferred
- Monitor usage to see if users find this pattern intuitive
