# Tetris Component Build Fix

## Issue Overview

Two custom Tetris-themed components were stuck in a `generating_code` status and failing to build properly:
- AnimateVariousTetrominoScene (ID: 69ecccb5-862c-43a7-b5a5-ddd7cf7776f3)
- OnceARowScene (ID: 46a6e2c8-8e1f-408a-b4a8-a131ec82e48a)

The components were failing during the esbuild compilation stage with syntax errors:
```
ERROR: Expected ")" but found ";"
```

## Root Cause Analysis

After thorough investigation, we identified that the components had JSX syntax errors - specifically, semicolons after JSX closing tags:

```jsx
// Problematic code example
return (
  <AbsoluteFill style={{ ... }}>
    {/* component content */}
  </AbsoluteFill>; // <- Semicolon here causes the esbuild error
);
```

These issues persisted even after updating the database records because:

1. The build worker uses a preprocessing pipeline (`tsxPreprocessor.ts`) before compilation
2. The preprocessor wasn't configured to detect and fix this specific syntax error pattern
3. We identified this by studying the logs which showed the pattern `</AbsoluteFill>; ` in the error messages

## Solution Implemented

We implemented a three-part solution:

### 1. Direct Database Fix

- Created `fix-tetris-direct.js` to update the component code directly in the database
- Replaced the problematic code with clean implementations
- Set component status to "building" to trigger the build process

```javascript
// Using node-postgres to update component code
const result = await client.query(`
  UPDATE "bazaar-vid_custom_component_job"
  SET "tsxCode" = $1,
      "status" = 'building'
  WHERE id = $2
  RETURNING id, status
`, [code, id]);
```

### 2. Preprocessor Enhancement

- Modified the `fixJsxStructure` function in `tsxPreprocessor.ts` to detect and fix semicolons after JSX tags
- Added a new pattern to catch and remove these problematic semicolons:

```typescript
// Pattern 0 (NEW): Remove semicolons after JSX closing tags
const jsxSemicolonPattern = /(<\/\w+>);\\s*(\)|,|{|$)/g;
if (jsxSemicolonPattern.test(result)) {
  result = result.replace(jsxSemicolonPattern, '$1 $2');
  issues.push('Removed semicolons after JSX closing tags');
  fixed = true;
  logger.debug('[ESBUILD-FIX] Removed semicolons after JSX closing tags');
}
```

### 3. Reset Components Script

- Created a bash script (`reset-components.sh`) to reset the components back to "building" status after the preprocessor fix
- Used PostgreSQL commands to update the status and trigger a rebuild

## Verification Process

After implementing the fixes:
1. The logs showed successful component code preprocessing
2. The esbuild compilation errors were resolved
3. Components transitioned from "building" to "complete" status

## Prevention Measures

To prevent this issue in the future:

1. Enhanced the preprocessor to detect and fix problematic JSX syntax patterns
2. Improved error logging for better diagnosis
3. Added documentation about common component build issues

## Conclusion

This fix ensures custom components with JSX syntax errors are properly detected and repaired during the build process, preventing them from getting stuck in the "generating_code" status.
