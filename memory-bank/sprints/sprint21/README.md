# Sprint 21: Custom Component Loading Fix

## Overview

Sprint 21 was focused on fixing critical issues with custom components that were stuck in "loading component" state with "no output URL" errors. The primary goal was to ensure all components are properly loaded and displayed in the Remotion player.

## Issues Addressed

1. Components marked as "ready" in the database but missing output URLs
2. Components missing the critical `window.__REMOTION_COMPONENT` assignment needed for Remotion
3. Multiple issues with component syntax that prevented proper rendering

## Key Implementations

### 1. Fix Missing Output URLs

Created `fix-missing-outputUrl.ts` to:
- Find components with 'ready' or 'complete' status but missing outputUrl
- Verify if the component exists in R2 storage
- Update the database with the correct URL

### 2. Ensure Remotion Component Assignment

Implemented multi-level fixes:
- Updated component template to always include the window assignment
- Enhanced syntax repair to add the assignment if missing
- Created a repair script for existing components (`fix-remotion-component-assignment.ts`)

### 3. Improved Build Process

- Added verification steps to ensure components have all required elements
- Enhanced error handling and logging throughout the process

## Scripts Created

1. `src/scripts/fix-missing-outputUrl.ts` - Fixes components with missing outputUrl
2. `src/scripts/fix-remotion-component-assignment.ts` - Adds window.__REMOTION_COMPONENT assignment
3. `src/scripts/run-component-fixes.sh` - Shell script to run both fixes

## Documentation

1. `memory-bank/sprints/sprint21/custom-component-loading-fix.md` - Detailed explanation of the issue and solution
2. Updated `memory-bank/progress.md` with the latest status

## Testing

The fixes were tested by:
- Running scripts on components in the production database
- Verifying that previously failing components now load properly
- Checking that new components created after the fix work correctly

## Next Steps

- Monitor component loading in production to ensure fixes are working
- Consider adding automated tests to verify component loading
- Look for additional optimizations in the build process
