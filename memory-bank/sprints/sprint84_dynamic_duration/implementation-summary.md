# Sprint 84: Dynamic Duration Implementation Summary

## What We Changed

### Enhanced LLM Prompts with Intelligent Duration Guidelines

We updated all three scene generation prompts to make smart duration decisions based on content:

### 1. Main Code Generator (`code-generator.ts`)
Added comprehensive duration guidelines:
- Single word/short text (1-3 words): 60 frames (2 seconds)
- Simple intro/logo: 90 frames (3 seconds)  
- Medium text/statement: 120 frames (4 seconds)
- Standard scene: 180 frames (6 seconds)
- Multiple elements: 210-240 frames (7-8 seconds)
- Complex animations: 270-360 frames (9-12 seconds)

Key instruction: "DO NOT default to 180 frames (6 seconds) for everything!"

### 2. Typography Generator (`typography-generator.ts`)
Added text-specific duration rules:
- 1-3 words: 60 frames - quick and punchy
- 4-8 words: 90 frames - comfortable reading
- 9-15 words: 120 frames - full sentence
- 16-25 words: 150 frames - short paragraph
- 25+ words: 180+ frames - but consider splitting!

Formula: Reading time (~3 words/second) + animation (15-20f) + hold (10-20f)

### 3. Image Recreator (`image-recreator.ts`)
Added visual complexity-based duration:
- Simple logo/icon: 90 frames (3 seconds)
- UI screenshot: 120 frames (4 seconds)  
- Data visualization: 150-180 frames (5-6 seconds)
- Multi-element dashboard: 180-240 frames (6-8 seconds)
- Complex animated recreation: 240-300 frames (8-10 seconds)

## Expected Results

### Before:
- "text: Hi" → 180 frames (way too long!)
- "intro of bazaar" → 180 frames (too long!)
- "epic product showcase" → 180 frames (too short!)

### After:
- "text: Hi" → 60 frames (perfect 2 seconds)
- "intro of bazaar" → 90 frames (snappy 3 seconds)
- "epic product showcase" → 240+ frames (appropriately epic)

## How It Works

1. **User Request**: "intro of bazaar"
2. **LLM Sees**: Request for simple intro
3. **LLM Applies**: Duration guideline for "Simple intro/logo: 90 frames"
4. **Generated Code**: `export const durationInFrames_ABC123 = 90;`
5. **Result**: 3-second intro instead of 6 seconds

## Key Benefits

1. **Better Pacing**: Scenes match their content complexity
2. **Less Manual Trimming**: Users won't need to adjust duration as often
3. **Professional Feel**: Quick cuts for simple content, longer for complex
4. **Smart Defaults**: LLM makes intelligent decisions based on what it's creating

## Testing Plan

1. Create various scenes without specifying duration:
   - "text: Welcome" → Should be 60 frames
   - "logo animation" → Should be 90 frames
   - "show three features" → Should be 210+ frames

2. Verify explicit duration still works:
   - "5 second intro" → Should override to 150 frames

3. Check all three tools:
   - Code generator (main ADD tool)
   - Typography tool
   - Image recreator tool

## Next Steps

1. Test the implementation with various prompts
2. Monitor if LLMs follow the new guidelines
3. Consider adding duration feedback in UI
4. Fix database default from 150 to 180 (minor consistency issue)

## Success Metrics

- 80%+ of scenes have appropriate duration for their content
- Reduced need for manual trimming
- Better video pacing overall
- User satisfaction with automatic duration choices
