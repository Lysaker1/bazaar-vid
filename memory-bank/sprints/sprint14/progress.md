# Sprint 14 Progress Update (as of current session)

## Overall Goal: GallerySwipe Ad MVP - End-to-End Pipeline Completion

Enable users to prompt for an ad video (e.g., "GallerySwipe" app ad) and have the system execute the full pipeline: User prompt → System generates scenes → Each scene gets an Animation Design Brief (ADB) → Components are generated → Playable video results. This includes UI controls for regeneration, system stability, and visibility into the process.

## Key Success Criteria & Status:

1.  **Execute Complete Pipeline:** In progress. Core services for orchestration, scene planning, ADB generation, and component generation are in place or being actively developed/tested.
2.  **Provide Sufficient UI Control:** In progress. UI elements for ADBs and scene regeneration are partially implemented and being refined (`ScenePlanningHistoryPanel.tsx`).
3.  **Demonstrate Stability:** Partially implemented. Basic error handling exists in services; comprehensive resilience is a target.
4.  **Deliver Visibility:** Good foundations. Streaming events for real-time updates are implemented in core services.

## Status of Sprint 14 Tickets (Summary):

*   **14.1: Fix Core Testing Infrastructure:**
    *   **Status:** In Progress.
    *   Significant progress made on Jest/ESM issues and mocking (OpenAI, Babel). Database mocking in tests (`animationDesigner.service.test.ts`) remains a challenge but has seen improvements.

*   **14.2: Complete Animation Design Brief (ADB) Generation & Testing:**
    *   **Status:** In Progress.
    *   `animationDesigner.service.ts` (for ADB generation) exists. The main focus is on comprehensive testing (Ticket 14.2.1, 14.2.7) which is ongoing. Sub-tasks like schema enhancements, prompt engineering, and deeper integration are mostly planned or in early stages.

*   **14.3: Implement Scene Planning Panel UI for ADBs:**
    *   **Status:** In Progress.
    *   `ScenePlanningHistoryPanel.tsx` has a foundational UI for ADBs. Recent refactoring addressed type safety and context usage. Key remaining work involves robust data fetching (`listDesignBriefs`), dynamic display of ADB content, full backend integration for ADB actions (generate/regenerate from UI), and ensuring real-time status updates (polling or WebSockets).

*   **14.4: Implement Scene Regeneration & Duration Feedback:**
    *   **Status:** Planned.
    *   UI elements and backend logic for direct scene regeneration and timeline feedback on duration discrepancies are mostly in the planning/design stage.

*   **14.5: Create End-to-End Testing Plan:**
    *   **Status:** Planned.
    *   Defining comprehensive test scenarios for the full GallerySwipe use case is in the planning stages.

*   **14.6: Enhance Error Handling & Resilience:**
    *   **Status:** Partially Implemented / Planned.
    *   Core services have some error handling. A dedicated effort to enhance system-wide resilience, fallbacks, and user-facing error communication is planned.

## Blocker/Challenges:

*   **Database Mocking in Tests:** Consistently and correctly mocking database interactions (Drizzle ORM with Neon) for services like `animationDesigner.service.ts` is proving complex and is a key focus for unblocking more comprehensive backend testing.
