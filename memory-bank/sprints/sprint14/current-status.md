# Sprint 14 Current Status Report

## Overview
This document provides a snapshot of the current status of Sprint 14 implementation, focusing on the end-to-end pipeline for generating videos from user prompts. The analysis is based on recent testing with the GallerySwipe ad prompt.

## What's Working

1. **Scene Planning**:
   - The Scene Planner successfully generates scene plans in the backend
   - Plans are correctly stored in the database
   - Scene duration and descriptions are appropriate for the requested video
   - Terminal logs show successful scene planning completion (~96 seconds)

2. **Animation Design Brief (ADB) Generation**:
   - The system attempts to generate ADbs for each scene
   - Some ADbs are successfully created with partial data

3. **UI Components**:
   - Chat Panel allows for user prompts
   - Scene Planning History Panel displays scenes once they're fully processed
   - Timeline Panel is integrated

## Issues Identified

1. **UI Feedback Delay**:
   - Major issue: 2+ minute delay between backend processing and UI updates
   - Scene planning completes in ~96 seconds in the backend but takes additional time to display in UI
   - User receives no immediate feedback that processing is happening

2. **Animation Design Brief Validation Failures**:
   - ADbs are being generated but failing validation
   - Example error: `Animation Design Brief validation failed. Issues: {...}`
   - System creates "fallback" ADbs with partial data

3. **Component Generation Failures**:
   - Most custom component jobs are showing "error" status
   - Database exports show many component jobs in error state
   - Component generation appears to work initially but fails later in the process

4. **Temperature Parameter Issues**:
   - Fixed: Removed unsupported temperature parameter when using o4-mini model

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **UI Delay Issues**:
   - Current implementation waits for complete database transactions before updating UI
   - No streaming updates or progressive rendering of partial results
   - Scene Planning History Panel doesn't show in-progress work

2. **ADB Validation Failures**:
   - Schema validation for animations is failing
   - Elements in position 1, 3, and 4 have animation object validation issues

3. **Component Generation Pipeline**:
   - The system successfully generates TSX code but the build process fails
   - Terminal logs show: `[COMPONENT GENERATOR] Successfully generated TSX code for job...` followed by errors later

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Fixes**:
   - Improve Scene Planning UI to show real-time updates without waiting for complete results
   - Debug Animation Design Brief validation failures and fix schema issues
   - Investigate and fix component build failures
   
2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Implement proper error handling and user feedback for component generation
   - Add progress indicators throughout the pipeline
   - Improve performance of slow tRPC procedures (customComponent.getJobStatus)

3. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Implement WebSocket-based real-time updates for all generation stages
   - Create more robust fallback mechanisms when component generation fails
   - Refine validation schema to be more flexible with partial data

## Database Status
From the exported database files:
- Many custom component jobs are in "error" state
- Scene plans are being correctly stored
- Projects are being created successfully

## Terminal Performance Metrics
- Scene planning completed in 96586ms
- tRPC procedure customComponent.getJobStatus is consistently slow (3000-9000ms)
- Database operations appear to be a bottleneck in the UI update process
