# Fix First Scene Context Issue - COMPLETED ✅

**Feature**: Fix First Scene Purple Bias
**Sprint**: 66
**Completed**: January 3, 2025
**Developer**: Assistant
**Status**: ✅ Successfully Implemented

## Overview

Successfully identified and fixed the root cause of all first scenes appearing with similar purple styling. The issue was a hardcoded purple gradient in the CODE_GENERATOR prompt that was being used as the default "warm" color option.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
- All first scenes were showing purple/pink gradients
- The CODE_GENERATOR prompt had specific gradient examples:
  ```
  Warm: linear-gradient from #f093fb to #f5576c
  Cool: linear-gradient from #4facfe to #00f2fe
  ```
- The "warm" gradient `#f093fb` is a purple/pink color
- AI was defaulting to these specific examples for most scenes

### Why It Happened
1. The prompt provided only 2 gradient options
2. The "warm" option was purple-biased
3. No guidance to match user context
4. No emphasis on variety for first scenes

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated CODE_GENERATOR Prompt
- Removed the specific purple gradient examples
- Added guidance to match user's prompt context
- Provided more variety in gradient examples
- Added emphasis on first scene uniqueness

### 2. Key Changes Made

```typescript
// BEFORE:
BACKGROUNDS AND VISUAL STYLE
If the user specified or provided an image, use the brand color for the background. if not available, use dynamic gradients for backgrounds such as:
Warm: linear-gradient from #f093fb to #f5576c
Cool: linear-gradient from #4facfe to #00f2fe

// AFTER:
BACKGROUNDS AND VISUAL STYLE
If the user specified or provided an image, use the brand color for the background. 

Otherwise, choose colors and gradients that match the user's prompt:
- Consider the tone and context of what they're creating
- Professional blues/grays for business content
- Use vibrant, energetic colors for fun/celebratory content
- Use calming greens/blues for educational content
- Create variety - each project should have its own visual identity

Examples of nice gradients (but always match the user's context):
- linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)
- linear-gradient(135deg, #11998e 0%, #38ef7d 100%)
- linear-gradient(135deg, #1e3c72 0%, #2a5298 100%)
- linear-gradient(135deg, #fc4a1a 0%, #f7b733 100%)
```

### 3. Added First Scene Emphasis
Added a new section at the beginning of the prompt:
```
FIRST SCENE VARIETY:
When creating the first scene of a project, ensure it's unique and matches the user's specific request. Don't default to any particular color scheme - let the content drive the visual choices.
```

## What We Didn't Change

### Context Building Logic
- The `previousSceneContext` logic in `generation/helpers.ts` was already correct
- It only passes previous scene context when `storyboard.length > 0`
- First scenes correctly get `undefined` for previousSceneContext

### Brain Orchestrator
- Context builder was working correctly
- No issues with context isolation between projects
- No caching problems found

## Expected Improvements

1. **Color Variety**: First scenes will now have colors that match the prompt
   - Business prompts → Professional blues/grays
   - Fun/party prompts → Bright, vibrant colors
   - Educational prompts → Calm greens/blues
   - Each project gets unique visual identity

2. **No Purple Default**: The purple bias has been removed entirely

3. **Better User Experience**: Users will see more creative and contextually appropriate first scenes

## Files Modified

1. **`/src/config/prompts/active/code-generator.ts`**
   - Removed purple gradient bias
   - Added context-driven color guidance
   - Added first scene variety emphasis
   - Provided diverse gradient examples

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the fix works:
1. Create multiple new projects with different prompts
2. Check that colors match the context (business vs fun vs educational)
3. Verify no consistent purple theme across projects
4. Ensure each project has unique visual identity

## Conclusion

The fix was simpler than anticipated - it was purely a prompt engineering issue rather than a complex context contamination problem. By removing the specific purple gradient and adding guidance to match user context, first scenes should now show much more variety and creativity.
