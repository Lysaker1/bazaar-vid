# Framer Motion + Remotion Integration Issue

## Problem
Framer Motion animations are time-based and run automatically, while Remotion needs frame-based control. The generated code is trying to control Framer Motion with `time > X` conditions, which doesn't work properly.

## Solution
For now, we should:
1. Remove Framer Motion from the window dependencies
2. Stick with Remotion's built-in animation tools (interpolate, spring)
3. Or implement a proper frame-to-time adapter

## Why It Failed
```jsx
// This doesn't work - Framer Motion runs on mount, not controlled by time
animate={{
  opacity: time > 0 ? 1 : 0,  // ❌ Not how Framer Motion works
  y: time > 0 ? 0 : 50,
}}
```

## What Works Better
```jsx
// Use Remotion's interpolate instead
const opacity = interpolate(frame, [0, 30], [0, 1]);
const y = interpolate(frame, [0, 30], [50, 0]);

style={{
  opacity,
  transform: `translateY(${y}px)`
}}
```

## Recommendation
Remove Framer Motion for now and focus on:
- Heroicons ✅ (working)
- Lucide ✅ (working)
- Remotion Shapes ✅ (working)

These provide immediate value without the complexity of integrating time-based animations with frame-based rendering.
