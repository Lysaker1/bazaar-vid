# Sprint 13.3: Scene Planning Panel Modifications for Animation Design Briefs

## Overview

This document outlines the necessary modifications to the Scene Planning History Panel to support the new Animation Design Brief feature. These changes enable users to view, generate, and regenerate animation design briefs directly from the scene planning interface without requiring additional navigation or complex UI panels.

## Requirements

### 1. Animation Brief Display
- Add a collapsible section to each scene card in the ScenePlanningHistoryPanel
- Display animation design briefs associated with each scene
- Show brief status (pending/complete/error) with appropriate visual indicators
- Format JSON content for better readability

### 2. Brief Generation Controls
- Add "Generate Animation Brief" button for scenes without briefs
- Add "Regenerate Animation Brief" button for scenes with existing briefs
- Show loading state during generation/regeneration
- Display error messages when brief generation fails

### 3. Scene-Brief Relationship
- Clearly indicate which briefs belong to which scenes
- Show timestamp for when briefs were created
- Display model version information

## Technical Implementation

### Component Modifications
- Update `ScenePlanningHistoryPanel.tsx` to integrate with the Animation Router
- Add states to manage brief expansion and display
- Create brief status indicators with proper styling
- Implement JSON formatting for brief content display

### Data Integration
- Use the `listDesignBriefs` API to fetch all briefs for a project
- Sort and group briefs by scene ID for efficient lookup
- Poll for updates every 5 seconds to show real-time status
- Trigger brief generation/regeneration via the `generateDesignBrief` API

### UI/UX Considerations
- Keep the UI simple and focused on the core task
- Use collapsible sections to manage information density
- Provide clear visual feedback for all operations
- Ensure consistent styling with the rest of the application

## Out of Scope
- Complex brief editing capabilities (simple viewing only)
- Separate animation preview canvas (will be addressed in future sprints)
- Animation parameter adjustment sliders or controls
- Animation template library

## Implementation Steps

1. Add new state variables for brief expansion and display
2. Integrate with the Animation Router API endpoints
3. Create brief status indicator components
4. Implement brief display sections for each scene
5. Add generation/regeneration buttons with proper loading states
6. Update the progress.md documentation

## Testing Criteria
- Briefs should be correctly displayed for each scene
- Generation/regeneration buttons should work correctly
- Status indicators should update in real-time
- JSON content should be properly formatted and readable
- Error states should be clearly displayed with helpful messages

## Dependencies
- Requires the Animation Design Brief database schema
- Requires the Animation Router API endpoints
- Uses the existing Scene Planning History Panel
