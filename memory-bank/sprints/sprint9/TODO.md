## Completed Tasks

1. âœ… Update model name from "gpt-4o-mini" to "gpt-o4-mini" throughout the codebase
   - Fixed in `src/server/workers/generateComponentCode.ts`
   - Fixed in `src/server/api/routers/chat.ts` (both streaming and regular API calls)
   - Updated in documentation

2. âœ… Update scene planning tool definition
   - Added fps field to required parameters
   - Ensured scene IDs are generated and passed to the component generator

3. âœ… Enhance component generation process
   - Modified `handleComponentGenerationInternal` to accept fps and sceneId parameters
   - Added support for trusting component duration over planned duration

4. âœ… Document changes in implementation spec
   - Added model standardization section
   - Updated diagrams and examples

5. âœ… Finalize `handleScenePlanInternal` implementation
   - Added comprehensive scene plan validation
   - Implemented scene repositioning for component over-runs
   - Added robust error handling and recovery

6. âœ… Add patch validation for scene timing integrity
   - Added validation checks for total duration correctness
   - Implemented error recovery for invalid patches

7. âœ… Implement scene repositioning for component over-runs
   - Added logic to reposition subsequent scenes when a component exceeds its planned duration
   - Preserve timing relationships between scenes when adjustments are needed

8. âœ… Enhance timeline UI with visual feedback for scene status
   - Added status indicators for scene timing issues (gaps, overlaps)
   - Implemented visual indicators for scene validity
   - Added keyboard shortcut help and status legend

## Remaining Tasks - Medium Priority

1. Implement scene regeneration button
   - Add a button to regenerate a scene with current parameters
   - Handle regeneration without disrupting timeline

2. Add UI feedback for actual component duration vs. planned duration
   - Show mismatch warnings when a component's duration differs from the plan
   - Provide visual indicators for discrepancies

3. Add visual progress indicators for scene generation
   - Show loading state in timeline while scene is being generated
   - Add progress indicators for long-running scene generation

## Remaining Tasks - Lower Priority

1. Improve error handling during scene generation
   - Add more detailed error messages when scene generation fails
   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed generations

2. Optimize scene plan generation for specific video types
   - Add specialized scene planning for different video styles/contexts
   - Fine-tune prompts for better scene type suggestions

## Testing Plan

1. ðŸ”„ Unit tests
   - Test scene planning validation
   - Test component metadata handling
   - Test JSON patch construction

2. ðŸ”„ Integration tests
   - Test end-to-end scene planning and generation
   - Test component over-run handling
   - Test error recovery scenarios

3. ðŸ”„ UI tests
   - Test timeline visualization with dynamic durations
   - Test status indicators
   - Test user interaction with scene editing

## Documentation

1. ðŸ”„ Update API documentation
   - Document scene planning endpoints
   - Document component generation parameters

2. ðŸ”„ Create user guide
   - Document how to use scene planning feature
   - Add examples of effective prompts
   - Create visual guide for timeline interaction
