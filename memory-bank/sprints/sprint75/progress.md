## Progress Log

### 2025-07-07: Sprint Kickoff
- Created Sprint 75 documentation structure
- Analyzed t3dotgg's Stripe recommendations
- Designed comprehensive integration plan
- **PIVOT**: Changed from subscription model to credit-based system
- Credit packages:
  - $15 → 1,500 credits (minimum)
  - $50 → 5,500 credits (10% bonus)
  - $100 → 12,000 credits (20% bonus)
  - $250 → 32,500 credits (30% bonus)
- Usage rates: 1080p video = 20 credits per 10 seconds
- Target margin: ~66% (3x markup on costs)
- Created implementation plan for credit system
- Documented database schema for credits

## Key Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Payment Model**: Credit-based system instead of subscriptions
2. **Customer Creation**: Create Stripe customer on first purchase
3. **Credit Storage**: Track balance in our database
4. **Usage Tracking**: Deduct credits before expensive operations

### Technical Choices
- Use Stripe Payment Intents for one-time purchases
- Simple webhook for payment success only
- No subscription management needed
- Credit balance checked before each operation
- Immediate credit addition after payment

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Calculate exact API costs for proper margin analysis
2. Finalize credit packages and pricing
3. Create Stripe account (payment mode only)
4. Design credit system database schema
5. Build CreditService class
6. Implement pre-export credit checks
