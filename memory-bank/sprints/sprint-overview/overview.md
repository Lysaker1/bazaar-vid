## Sprint 13: Animation Design Brief - Broader Integrations & UI

-   **Primary Focus:** Integrating Animation Design Briefs (ADBs) more deeply into the video generation pipeline and enhancing UI components to support this.
-   **Features & Modifications:**
    -   Focused on how ADBs are utilized within the broader video creation flow.
    -   Modifications discussed for `ScenePlanningHistoryPanel.tsx` to enable users to view, manage, and potentially interact with ADBs associated with their scenes.
-   **Design Decisions & Considerations:**
    -   Emphasized creating a user-friendly interface for managing scene planning alongside ADBs.
    -   Considered architectural aspects for real-time updates and status tracking related to scene generation and ADB processing.
-   **Key Learnings/Context:** This sprint aimed to make ADBs a more integral and visible part of the user's scene design and iteration process.

## Sprint 12: Intelligent Animation Design Layer Implementation

-   **Primary Focus:** Introducing and implementing an intelligent Animation Design Layer, using LLMs to generate structured Animation Design Briefs (ADBs) that guide Remotion component creation.
-   **Features Added:**
    -   Developed a system for generating detailed ADBs via LLMs, moving from simple text prompts to structured JSON-based briefs.
    -   Implemented a new database schema (`animationDesignBriefs` table in `src/server/db/schema.ts`) for storing ADBs, including status, LLM model used, and associated component job ID. (Details in MEMORY[025c0360-dc14-4e89-b754-110111970ad3])
    -   Defined a comprehensive Zod schema for `AnimationDesignBrief` in `src/lib/schemas/animationDesignBrief.schema.ts` covering elements, animations, layout, palettes, typography, and audio. (Details in MEMORY[ea5edfea-8aab-43d6-b5a5-5b759674ff21])
    -   Created a new tRPC router (`src/server/api/routers/animation.ts`) with procedures for ADB management (`generateDesignBrief`, `getDesignBrief`, etc.).
-   **Dependencies & APIs:**
    -   Utilized OpenAI's LLM for ADB generation.
-   **Design Decisions:**
    -   Adopted a structured JSON schema for ADBs to ensure clarity, consistency, and type safety.
    -   Implemented robust error handling and logging for the ADB generation process.
    -   Modified `chat.ts` (specifically `regenerateComponent` and `processUserMessageInProject` for the `generateRemotionComponent` tool) to first generate an ADB, then use that brief for component generation. (Details in MEMORY[ae99f933-8249-4910-a01d-b742fb46508a])
-   **Key Outcomes:** Established a more structured, reproducible, and debuggable process for generating animations, with ADBs serving as a detailed blueprint.

## Sprint 11: Fixing OpenAI Tool Call Streaming

-   **Primary Focus:** Addressing and resolving issues related to the streaming of OpenAI tool calls, particularly ensuring reliable parsing and execution.
-   **Features Modified & Enhancements:**
    -   Refactored stream processing logic, likely within `chatOrchestration.service.ts` or similar, to correctly handle and parse streaming responses that include tool calls.
    -   Improved error logging and debugging capabilities associated with tool call streaming to enhance traceability of issues.
    -   Implemented an event buffering system, potentially to support reconnection or ensure data integrity during streaming sessions.
-   **Bugs Resolved:**
    -   Addressed and fixed previous failures in tool execution that were caused by improper parsing or handling of streaming data from OpenAI.
-   **Key Outcomes:** Increased reliability and robustness of features that depend on OpenAI tool calls, particularly those involving real-time or streamed interactions.

## Sprint 9: Intelligent Scene Planning & Dynamic Duration System

-   **Core Goal:** Transition from fixed-duration scenes to a dynamic system where an LLM ("gpt-o4-mini") intelligently plans scene count, types, and durations based on user requests, using a two-step LLM process.
-   **Key Features & Implementation Details:**
    -   **`planVideoScenes` tool:** Analyzes user intent to determine scene count, overall video duration, FPS (default 30), and a detailed plan for each scene (ID, description, duration, effect type).
    -   **`generateRemotionComponent` tool:** Called per planned scene to generate component code, respecting planned duration and FPS.
    -   **Dynamic Durations:** Scene durations are LLM-planned but can be overridden by a component's intrinsic duration ("component over-run").
    -   **Scene Identity:** Unique scene IDs generated by the planner are passed through the generation process.
    -   **Real-time Feedback:** Scene plan and generation status (pending, building, success, error) are streamed to the UI.
    -   **Atomic Updates:** A single, validated JSON patch (`inputPropsSchema`) updates the project's video state after component generation.
    -   **Component Over-run Handling:** Subsequent scenes are repositioned, and total video duration is adjusted if a component exceeds its planned duration.
    -   **Error Handling:** Fallback to a single 5s scene on planning failure; placeholder text scene on individual component generation failure. Limits: max 10 scenes, max 60s total. Parallel generation capped (e.g., 3 at once).
    -   **Database:** `projects.metadata.lastScenePlan`; `customComponentJobs.metadata` stores `durationInFrames`, `fps`, `scenePlanId`.
    -   **Client-Side:** `ChatPanel` displays the plan; `TimelinePanel` shows dynamic scenes with status indicators. Drag scene to chat for editing.
-   **Completed Tasks (Highlights):** Model standardization to "gpt-o4-mini", updates to planning/generation tools, `handleScenePlanInternal` finalization, patch validation, UI feedback for scene status.
-   **Remaining Tasks (at end of Sprint 9):** Scene regeneration button, UI for duration discrepancies, generation progress indicators, enhanced error handling/retries, optimized planning for video types, comprehensive tests, and documentation.

## Sprint 8: Timeline Enhancements & Validation

-   **Core Goal:** Improve timeline usability and robustness by integrating professional video editing features (inspired by "react-video-editor-pro") and implementing strong client-side/server-side validation for timeline operations.
-   **Key Issue Addressed:** Operations (drag/resize) causing scenes to have zero duration, failing server-side Zod validation (`inputPropsSchema` requiring duration >= 1).
-   **Implemented Solutions & Features:**
    -   **Client-Side Validation:** Logic in timeline hooks (e.g., `useTimelineDragAndDrop.ts`) prevents operations leading to duration < 1, with visual feedback (red highlighting, snap to minimum duration).
    -   **Ported Hooks:** `useTimelineClick` (click-to-seek), `useTimelineZoom` (wheel zoom), `useTimelineDragAndDrop`/`useTimelineDrag` (move/resize with collision detection & validation).
    -   **`TimelineContext` Refactor:** Unified context for timeline state and logic.
    -   **Enhanced Drag/Drop (`useTimelineDrag`):** Supports move, resize (start/end); visual feedback (ghost element, validity color-coding); validation for min duration, bounds, collisions, row ranges; pointer events.
    -   **`TimelineItem`/`TimelineGrid` Updates:** Integrated new hooks, improved styles, drag-to-chat support, ghost item display, playhead marker.
    -   **Scene Insertion Logic:** Improved to clamp row placement and find gaps.
    -   **Server-Side:** Persisted `lastScenePlan`, handled dynamic FPS, fallback for component errors in chat router. Implemented Zod schema validation for JSON patches.
-   **Key Outcomes:** Prevention of invalid timeline states (zero-length, overlaps); precise zoom/click; real-time planning feedback; persistent plan metadata; reduced runtime failures.
-   **Remaining Tasks (at end of Sprint 8):** UI feedback (gaps, undo/redo), tRPC mutations for timeline persistence (`updateTimeline`), large timeline optimization, in-app error notifications, advanced drag/drop (snapping, multi-select, split), visual enhancements (thumbnails, hover info).

## Sprint 7: Build Worker Optimization & Streaming Chat

-   **Core Goals:** 
    1.  Optimize the custom component build worker system for performance, stability, and observability.
    2.  Implement streaming chat responses for real-time user feedback.
-   **Build Worker Optimizations:**
    -   **TSX Code Wrapping (`wrapTsxWithGlobals`):** Enabled `external: ['react', 'remotion']` in esbuild, drastically reducing bundle sizes (>90%) and improving component load times.
    -   **Worker Pool & Concurrency Limits:** Implemented a simple worker pool limiting concurrent builds to `cpuCount - 1` (configurable via `MAX_CONCURRENT_BUILDS`), preventing CPU saturation and improving server stability.
    -   **Performance Metrics & Utility (`src/lib/metrics.ts`):** Introduced `recordMetric` and `measureDuration`. Detailed build metrics (duration, success/failure, errors, job IDs) stored in a `metrics` table for monitoring and alerting.
    -   **esbuild Configuration:** Standardized on `format: "esm"`, `external: ["react", "remotion", ...]`, and `minify: true`.
-   **Streaming Chat Response (Leveraging MEMORY[5ec18d04-72e8-4152-9d92-517b25f9c2bc]):**
    -   **Real-time Feedback:** Achieved sub-250ms initial response time for chat.
    -   **Chat Router Enhancements:** Utilized Vercel AI SDK's `OpenAIStream` and tRPC's `experimental_stream` for efficient token streaming and browser compatibility. Implemented real-time database updates for message content.
    -   **Exponential Backoff Utility:** Created a utility to intelligently handle OpenAI API rate limits (429 errors) with jitter and smart error classification.
    -   Supported the two-phase (intent + code) component generation pipeline.
-   **Key Outcomes:** Significantly faster and more stable component builds; more responsive and robust chat interactions.
