# Sprint 26 Progress

## Video Generation Feature Implementation

### Completed Tasks

- ✅ Created the basic UI structure for the video generation feature
  - Added project/[id]/generate page
  - Implemented GenerateVideoClient component
  - Created supporting UI components (PromptForm, GenerationProgress, StoryboardViewer)

- ✅ Defined type interfaces for Storyboard schema
  - Added Scene, VideoStyle, Asset, AssetMetadata types
  - Implemented GenerationState to track generation progress

- ✅ Fixed ESM module loading in test-component.ts
  - Added proper .js extensions to imports
  - Added esbuild-plugin-external-global dependency

- ✅ Implemented agent architecture for video generation
  - Created interfaces for all agent types (SceneAgent, StyleAgent, AssetAgent, CodeGenerator)
  - Implemented prompt orchestrator pattern for agent coordination
  - Added agent implementations:
    - AISceneAgent: Generates scene timeline based on user prompt
    - AIStyleAgent: Creates consistent visual style for the video
    - AIAssetAgent: Identifies assets needed for the video
    - AICodeGenerator: Generates code for video scenes
- ✅ Added in-browser compilation using Sucrase and dynamic Remotion preview
  - Components compile to ESM modules with React/Remotion globals
  - RemotionPreview loads compiled scenes via React.lazy

### Current Status

The video generation feature now has the complete agent architecture implemented. The agents are properly typed and follow a coordinated workflow:

1. User enters a prompt
2. PromptOrchestrator manages the sequential execution of agents:
   - SceneAgent plans the scenes/timeline
   - StyleAgent generates a visual style
   - AssetAgent identifies required resources
   - CodeGenerator creates component code

Each agent uses the OpenAI API to leverage AI capabilities for their specialized tasks, with proper error handling and fallback options if API calls fail.

### Next Steps

- Add a preview player to visualize the generated video
- Create a saving mechanism to persist storyboards
- Add the ability to edit generated storyboards
- Implement asset management for generated videos

### Lessons Learned

- Importance of proper typing for complex agent interactions
- Benefits of the orchestrator pattern for coordinating multiple AI agents
- Techniques for providing meaningful feedback during async generation processes
