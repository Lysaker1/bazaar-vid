# Sprint 53: Context System Analysis & Fixes

## What We Found

### The Problem
1. **Ghost Features**: System queries empty database tables (user preferences, image analyses) that are NEVER written to
2. **Missing Basics**: Tools can't see other scenes' code, making "match scene 1's colors" impossible
3. **Broken Continuity**: Add scene doesn't use previous scene for style reference (even though the code exists)

### The Numbers
- **4 database queries** per request (2 are always empty)
- **~50ms** wasted time
- **~170 tokens** wasted on empty data
- **0% success rate** for cross-scene style matching

## What We Fixed

### ‚úÖ Fix 1: Add Scene Continuity (DONE)
Added previousSceneContext to make new scenes match previous style automatically:
```typescript
// In helpers.ts
previousSceneContext: storyboard.length > 0 ? {
  tsxCode: storyboard[storyboard.length - 1].tsxCode,
  style: undefined
} : undefined,
```

## What's Next (Priority Order)

### üîß Fix 2: Cross-Scene References (2 hours)
Enable "make scene 2 match scene 1's colors":

1. **Update Brain Decision** to detect referenced scenes
2. **Pass reference scenes** to edit tool
3. **Update edit tool** to use reference code

### üóëÔ∏è Fix 3: Delete Ghost Features (1 hour)
1. Remove ProjectMemoryService entirely
2. Remove userPreferences and imageAnalyses from context
3. Save 2 DB queries and 170 tokens per request

### üöÄ Future: Smart Context (1 week)
- Extract and cache scene properties (colors, animations)
- Build real project style profiles
- Smart context inclusion based on intent

## The Core Insight

The system was built for imaginary future needs (user preferences, async image analysis) while missing basic current needs (passing scene code between tools). We're fixing that.
