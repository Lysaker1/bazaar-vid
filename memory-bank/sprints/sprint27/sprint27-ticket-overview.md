## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

### Week 1: Foundation Cleanup (BAZAAR-305)
**Focus**: Make the system idiot-proof and establish solid foundations

**Tasks**:
- Fix project management and listing
- Consolidate state management patterns
- Establish clear component boundaries
- Implement error boundaries and session management

**Deliverables**:
- Proper "My Projects" dashboard
- Unified state management documentation
- Clean component architecture
- Reliable user session handling

### Week 2-3: Parallel Feature Development
**Focus**: Build MVP implementations of next-gen features

**BAZAAR-306 (GitHub Integration)**:
- Week 2: OAuth integration and repository selection
- Week 3: Style extraction and workspace integration

**BAZAAR-307 (Image Analysis)**:
- Week 2: Upload system and AI vision integration
- Week 3: Scene generation and workspace integration

**BAZAAR-308 (Prompt Engineering)**:
- Week 2: Model management and template system
- Week 3: A/B testing and analytics integration

### Week 4: Integration & Polish
**Focus**: Ensure all features work together seamlessly

**Tasks**:
- Cross-feature integration testing
- Performance optimization
- User experience polish
- Documentation and deployment

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **System Reliability**: 99%+ uptime, no critical errors
- **Feature Adoption**: >40% of users try new features within 2 weeks
- **Performance**: No degradation in existing workspace performance
- **Quality**: Generation success rates improve across all features

### User Experience Metrics
- **Project Management**: Users can find and switch between projects easily
- **GitHub Integration**: No-code developers can connect repos and extract styles
- **Image Analysis**: Users can upload images and get matching video styles
- **Prompt Engineering**: Developers can experiment with models and prompts

### Business Metrics
- **User Retention**: Improved retention after using new features
- **Feature Stickiness**: Users return to use features multiple times
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduced generation costs through better prompting
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on new capabilities

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Breaking Changes**: Implement incrementally with feature flags
- **State Migration**: Ensure backward compatibility during cleanup
- **API Limits**: Implement proper rate limiting and fallbacks
- **Performance**: Monitor and optimize resource usage

### Product Risks
- **Feature Complexity**: Keep MVP scope minimal and focused
- **User Confusion**: Provide clear onboarding and documentation
- **Integration Issues**: Test cross-feature interactions thoroughly
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to MVP definitions and iterate later

## 📝 Notes

### Startup Approach
- **Ship Fast**: Focus on MVP implementations that can be iterated
- **User Feedback**: Gather feedback early and often
- **Technical Debt**: Clean up foundations before building new features
- **Resource Efficiency**: Parallel development where dependencies allow

### Focus on `/projects/[id]/generate/page.tsx`
- This is the main workspace where users spend their time
- All new features should integrate seamlessly into this interface
- Maintain the existing 4-panel layout (Chat, Preview, Storyboard, Code)
- Add new capabilities without disrupting existing workflows

### Future Considerations
- These foundations will support more advanced features in future sprints
- GitHub integration can expand to component-level analysis
- Image analysis can support video-to-video style transfer
- Prompt engineering can enable advanced AI workflows
