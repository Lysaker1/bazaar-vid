# SPRINT 28: PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST üöÄ

**Status**: GOING LIVE TONIGHT  
**Target**: Reddit Beta Users  
**Date**: May 25, 2025  
**Domain**: bazaar.it

## üéØ MISSION CRITICAL - MUST COMPLETE BEFORE LIVE

### üîê **1. OAUTH & AUTHENTICATION**

#### **What is OAuth?**
OAuth (Open Authorization) is a secure authorization framework that allows users to log in using their existing accounts (Google, GitHub, etc.) without sharing passwords with your app. Here's how it works:

1. **User clicks "Login with Google"** ‚Üí Redirects to Google's servers
2. **Google authenticates user** ‚Üí User enters their Google credentials on Google's site (not yours)
3. **Google asks for permission** ‚Üí "Allow Bazaar to access your basic profile?"
4. **User approves** ‚Üí Google sends a secure token back to your app
5. **Your app uses token** ‚Üí To get user info and create/login the user

**Why OAuth for production domain?**
- ‚úÖ **Security**: Users never enter passwords on your site
- ‚úÖ **Trust**: Users trust Google/GitHub more than unknown sites
- ‚úÖ **Convenience**: No password reset flows, account management
- ‚úÖ **Domain Validation**: OAuth providers verify your domain ownership
