# Sprint 28: PRODUCTION LAUNCH üöÄ

**Duration**: May 25, 2025 (1 day sprint - LAUNCH DAY!)  
**Status**: GOING LIVE TONIGHT  
**Target**: Reddit Beta Users

## üéØ **SPRINT GOAL**
Successfully deploy Bazaar-Vid to production and launch beta to Reddit community with zero critical issues.

## üìã **SPRINT SCOPE**

### **Primary Objectives**
1. **Production Deployment** - Deploy stable, secure, scalable version
2. **OAuth Setup** - Configure production authentication 
3. **Infrastructure Validation** - Ensure all systems are production-ready
4. **Reddit Beta Launch** - Announce to beta community
5. **Real-time Monitoring** - Monitor launch and respond to issues

### **Out of Scope**
- New feature development
- Major UI changes
- Sprint 27 tickets (BAZAAR-305-308)

## üèóÔ∏è **TECHNICAL FOUNDATION**

### **What We're Launching**
- ‚úÖ **Core Generation System** (Sprint 24-26)
- ‚úÖ **4-Panel Workspace** (Chat, Preview, Storyboard, Code)
- ‚úÖ **Scene-First Generation** (BAZAAR-302)
- ‚úÖ **ESM Component System** (BAZAAR-300)
- ‚úÖ **Animation Focus** (BAZAAR-301)
- ‚úÖ **Workspace UI** (BAZAAR-304)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Publish Pipeline** (Backend complete, frontend basic)

### **Known Limitations**
- "My Projects" dashboard not yet implemented
- Advanced publish UI not complete
- Image analysis not yet integrated
- GitHub integration not yet available

## üîê **OAUTH EXPLANATION**

### **Why OAuth is Essential for Production**

**Without OAuth (risky):**
- Users create passwords on your unknown site
- You handle password resets, security, breaches
- Users don't trust new sites with passwords
- You need email verification, account recovery

**With OAuth (secure):**
- Users login with Google/GitHub (trusted)
- No passwords stored on your servers
- Instant trust and credibility
- Professional authentication flow

### **OAuth Flow for Bazaar-Vid**
1. User visits `yourdomain.com`
2. Clicks "Login with Google"
3. Redirects to `accounts.google.com`
4. User enters Google credentials (on Google's secure site)
5. Google asks: "Allow Bazaar-Vid to access your profile?"
6. User approves ‚Üí Google sends secure token to your app
7. Your app creates user account with Google profile info
8. User is logged in and can start creating videos

## üö® **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**

### **Must Work Perfectly**
1. **OAuth Login** - Users must be able to sign up/login
2. **Scene Generation** - Core chat ‚Üí scene creation flow
3. **Preview System** - Users must see their scenes render
4. **Project Persistence** - Work must save across sessions
5. **Performance** - App must be responsive under load

### **Can Have Minor Issues**
1. **Publishing** - Backend works, UI is basic
2. **Mobile Experience** - Desktop-first launch
3. **Advanced Features** - Focus on core workflow

## üìä **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **Launch Day Targets**
- **Signups**: 50+ new users from Reddit
- **Scene Generations**: 100+ scenes created
- **Uptime**: 99%+ availability
- **Performance**: <3s page load times
- **Error Rate**: <1% of requests

### **Week 1 Targets**
- **User Retention**: 30%+ return within 7 days
- **Scene Completion**: 70%+ of started scenes completed
- **Community Engagement**: Active Reddit discussion
- **Feature Requests**: Collect feedback for Sprint 29
