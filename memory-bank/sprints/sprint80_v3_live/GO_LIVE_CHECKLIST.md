  - Test migration rollback plan

- [ ] **Cascade deletion verification**
  - Status: PENDING
  - Test project deletion cascades to:
    - All scenes in project
    - All chat messages
    - All uploaded images
    - All generated components
  - Verify no orphaned data remains

  - Purchase modal triggers on rate limit
  - Quota reset timing (timezone aware)

### 3. AI & Generation Pipeline
- [x] **Remove Scene Planner for v3**
  - Status: COMPLETED ‚úÖ
  - Comment out scene planner tool in brain orchestrator
  - Scene planner is v4 feature only
  - Ensure brain doesn't select this tool
  - Verified: Already disabled in brain-orchestrator.ts prompt
  
- [x] **Multi-format code generation**
  - Status: COMPLETED ‚úÖ
  - Fixed all hardcoded dimensions in prompts:
    - CODE_GENERATOR: Removed hardcoded 1920x1080, added format-aware text sizing
    - TYPOGRAPHY_GENERATOR: Fixed 1840px/1000px checks, added format support
    - IMAGE_RECREATOR: Made padding and scaling format-aware
  - All prompts now use {{WIDTH}}, {{HEIGHT}}, {{FORMAT}} placeholders
  - Text sizes scale based on format (5% for portrait, 8% for landscape)
  - Still needs testing with actual generation
  
- [x] **Auto-fix system**
  - Status: COMPLETED ‚úÖ
  - Silent progressive fixing works
  - Loop detection functional
  - No infinite retry loops
  - Event system properly initialized
  - Rate limiting in place

- [ ] **Brain orchestrator**
  - Status: PENDING
  - Verify tool selection logic
  - Test context building
  - Check conversation history handling
  - Confirm scene planner is excluded

- [x] **Prompt Enhancer Optimization**
  - Status: COMPLETED ‚úÖ
  - Fixed: Now focused on Bazaar-Vid's specific strengths
  - Enhanced to suggest:
    - Specific animation types we support (typewriter, fade-in, slide-in, bounce)
    - Timing details ("2-second intro", "0.5s stagger")
    - Visual hierarchy terms ("large hero text", "smaller supporting")
    - Format-specific optimizations for portrait/square/landscape
    - Executable instructions instead of vague descriptions
  - Reduced temperature to 0.4 for consistency
  - Shortened max tokens to 300 for conciseness
  - Added examples to guide the AI

### 4. Infrastructure & Deployment
- [ ] **Environment variables**
  - Status: PENDING
  - All required env vars documented
  - Separate configs for dev/staging/prod
  - AWS Lambda settings correct
  - Cloudflare R2 credentials valid

  - Download triggers properly
  - Progress tracking accurate

### 4.5 Smart Logo Detection & Usage
- [ ] **Logo Detection System**
  - Status: PENDING
  - When user uploads an image in chat:
    - Detect if it's a logo (transparent bg, simple design, brand-like)
    - Tag the image with "logo" metadata
    - Store logo URL in project context
  - Brain orchestrator should:
    - Know when a logo is available
    - Include logo in relevant scenes (intros, outros, watermarks)
    - Pass logo URL to generation tools
  - Implementation Plan:
    1. **Update Upload Route** (`/api/upload/route.ts`):
       - Add "isLogo" detection logic
       - Check for: transparent background, aspect ratio, file name contains "logo"
       - Add metadata tag to S3 upload
    2. **Store Logo in Project Memory** (`projectMemory` table):
       - Create memory entry: type="brand_logo", content={url, dimensions}
       - One logo per project (latest overwrites)
    3. **Update Brain Context** (`brain/contextBuilder.ts`):
       - Check projectMemory for logo
       - Add logoUrl to context if exists
    4. **Modify Generation Prompts**:
       - CODE_GENERATOR: Accept {{LOGO_URL}} placeholder
       - Add instructions for logo placement
    5. **Smart Usage Rules**:
       - First scene: Logo reveal animation
       - Last scene: Logo with CTA
       - Long videos: Subtle watermark
       - Don't use in every scene
