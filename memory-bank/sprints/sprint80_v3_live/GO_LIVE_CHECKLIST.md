### 3. AI & Generation Pipeline
- [x] **Remove Scene Planner for v3**
  - Status: COMPLETED ‚úÖ
  - Comment out scene planner tool in brain orchestrator
  - Scene planner is v4 feature only
  - Ensure brain doesn't select this tool
  - Verified: Already disabled in brain-orchestrator.ts prompt
  
- [x] **Multi-format code generation**
  - Status: COMPLETED ‚úÖ
  - Fixed all hardcoded dimensions in prompts:
    - CODE_GENERATOR: Removed hardcoded 1920x1080, added format-aware text sizing
    - TYPOGRAPHY_GENERATOR: Fixed 1840px/1000px checks, added format support
    - IMAGE_RECREATOR: Made padding and scaling format-aware
  - All prompts now use {{WIDTH}}, {{HEIGHT}}, {{FORMAT}} placeholders
  - Text sizes scale based on format (5% for portrait, 8% for landscape)
  - Still needs testing with actual generation
  
- [x] **Auto-fix system**
  - Status: COMPLETED ‚úÖ
  - Silent progressive fixing works
  - Loop detection functional
  - No infinite retry loops
  - Event system properly initialized

    - Specific animation types we support (typewriter, fade-in, slide-in, bounce)
    - Timing details ("2-second intro", "0.5s stagger")
    - Visual hierarchy terms ("large hero text", "smaller supporting")
    - Format-specific optimizations for portrait/square/landscape
    - Executable instructions instead of vague descriptions
  - Reduced temperature to 0.4 for consistency

### 4.5 Smart Logo Detection & Usage
- [x] **Logo Detection System - Phase 1: Prompt Updates**
  - Status: COMPLETED ‚úÖ (Phase 1)
  - **Phase 1 Completed**: Updated all generation prompts to properly use <Img> component
    - CODE_GENERATOR: Added clear instructions for displaying vs recreating images
    - CODE_EDITOR: Added image handling section with Img component usage
    - IMAGE_RECREATOR: Now differentiates between displaying actual images vs recreating designs
    - All prompts now include Img in Remotion destructuring
  - **Phase 2 TODO**: Smart logo detection and storage
    - When user uploads an image in chat:
      - Detect if it's a logo (transparent bg, simple design, brand-like)
      - Tag the image with "logo" metadata
      - Store logo URL in project context
    - Brain orchestrator should:
      - Know when a logo is available
      - Include logo in relevant scenes (intros, outros, watermarks)
      - Pass logo URL to generation tools
    - Implementation Plan:
      1. **Update Upload Route** (`/api/upload/route.ts`):
         - Add "isLogo" detection logic
         - Check for: transparent background, aspect ratio, file name contains "logo"
         - Add metadata tag to S3 upload
      2. **Store Logo in Project Memory** (`projectMemory` table):
         - Create memory entry: type="brand_logo", content={url, dimensions}
         - One logo per project (latest overwrites)
      3. **Update Brain Context** (`brain/contextBuilder.ts`):
         - Check projectMemory for logo
         - Add logoUrl to context if exists
      4. **Smart Usage Rules**:
         - First scene: Logo reveal animation
         - Last scene: Logo with CTA
         - Long videos: Subtle watermark
         - Don't use in every scene

## üîç KNOWN ISSUES TO FIX

### Critical Bugs
1. **Edit Tool Response Truncation/Timeout**
   - Error: "Unterminated string in JSON" - consistent truncation
   - Symptoms: 
     - Response truncated at ~10KB first time ("useVideoCon")
     - Response truncated at ~29KB second time ("window.R")
     - Response time: 136+ seconds (over 2 minutes)
   - Root cause: Infrastructure response size/streaming limit
   - Likely culprits:
     - CloudFlare 100MB response limit + 100s timeout
     - Vercel serverless function response streaming limits
     - Next.js API route buffering
   - Impact: HIGH - Edit operations fail for any complex scene
   - Status: CONFIRMED - Infrastructure limitation
   - Workarounds:
     - Use smaller, targeted edits
     - Delete and recreate scenes instead of large edits
     - Implement response streaming/chunking (requires major refactor)

2. **Timeline utils broken imports**
   - File: TimelineContext.tsx
   - Error: Import resolution failing (missing useTimelineValidation hook)
   - Impact: HIGH
   - Status: FIXED ‚úÖ
   - Solution: Moved validation functions directly into TimelineContext.tsx

2. **Variable name collisions in multi-scene compositions**
   - Error: "Identifier 'accumulatedFrames' has already been declared"
   - Cause: Multiple scenes using same global variable names
   - Impact: HIGH - Prevents multi-scene preview
   - Status: PROMPT FIXES APPLIED
   - Solution: Updated all generation prompts to enforce unique variable suffixes

3. **Typography tool generating "x" prefix**
   - Error: Generated code starts with "x" character before actual code
   - Cause: AI model adding mysterious prefix
   - Impact: HIGH - Breaks scene compilation
   - Status: PROMPT FIXES APPLIED
   - Solution: Added explicit instruction to ALL prompts to start with "const {"

4. **Scene compilation errors**
   - Frequency: Intermittent
   - Auto-fix handles most cases
   - Status: PARTIALLY FIXED

5. **Memory leaks in preview**
   - During long sessions
   - Impact: MEDIUM
   - Status: NOT FIXED

6. **Excessive re-renders (FIXED)**
   - ChatPanelG was re-rendering on every keystroke
   - Console.log statements in render causing issues
   - Status: FIXED ‚úÖ
   - Solution: Removed debug logs, fixed useCallback dependencies

### Minor Issues
1. **Missing ImageUpload.tsx component**
   - Build error: "No such file or directory"
   - Status: FIXED ‚úÖ
   - Solution: Created ImageUpload.tsx component based on ChatPanelG usage
   - File created at: src/components/chat/ImageUpload.tsx

2. **UI glitches on mobile**
   - Responsive design issues
   - Chat input gets hidden by keyboard
   - Preview panel not scrollable on small screens
   - Buttons too small for touch targets
   - Status: NOT FIXED
   - See Section 10 for comprehensive mobile fixes

3. **Slow initial load**
   - Bundle splitting needed
   - Status: NOT FIXED
