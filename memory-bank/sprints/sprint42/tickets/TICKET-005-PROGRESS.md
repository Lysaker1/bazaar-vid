# TICKET-005 Progress: Brain Context Building

## Status: COMPLETED âœ…

### Date: 2025-01-14

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented async image analysis for context building while ensuring the brain orchestrator never selects image analysis as a tool. The implementation focuses on enhancing context without interfering with tool selection.

### 1. What Was Implemented

#### Core Requirements Met:
- âœ… Removed image analysis tool selection from BRAIN_ORCHESTRATOR prompt
- âœ… Enhanced intent analyzer to better communicate about multimodal tools
- âœ… Added async image analysis method to projectMemory service
- âœ… Updated generation router to trigger async image analysis for context

#### Key Features:
1. **Brain Prompt Updates**: Completely removed analyzeImage from available tools and emphasized that all tools are multimodal
2. **Intent Analyzer Enhancement**: Now provides better image context to brain without suggesting image analysis tools
3. **Async Image Analysis**: Fire-and-forget analysis that stores context without blocking generation flow
4. **Router Integration**: Automatically triggers image analysis when images are present in messages

### 2. Key Changes Made

#### A. Brain Orchestrator Prompt (`/src/config/prompts.config.ts`)
- **Removed**: `analyzeImage` from available tools list
- **Added**: Critical note: "ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Tools are MULTIMODAL and handle images directly. NEVER select image analysis tools - they don't exist in your toolset."
- **Updated**: Image handling section to emphasize tools process images directly
- **Removed**: All decision paths that could lead to analyzeImage selection

#### B. Intent Analyzer (`/src/brain/orchestrator_functions/intentAnalyzer.ts`)
- **Enhanced**: Image context detection and description
- **Added**: Better communication about image content without suggesting analysis tools
- **Improved**: Intent extraction to include visual context for tool selection

#### C. Project Memory Service (`/src/server/services/data/projectMemory.service.ts`)
- **Added**: `startAsyncImageAnalysis()` method for fire-and-forget analysis
- **Implemented**: Non-blocking image analysis that runs in background
- **Integrated**: Stores analysis results as memories for future context

#### D. Generation Router (`/src/server/api/routers/generation.clean.ts`)
- **Added**: Async image analysis triggers in appropriate endpoints
- **Updated**: `sendMessage` to trigger analysis when images present
- **Ensured**: Analysis never blocks or affects tool selection flow

### 3. Files Modified with References

#### `/src/config/prompts.config.ts`
```typescript
// Line changes in BRAIN_ORCHESTRATOR prompt:
// - Removed analyzeImage from tools list
// - Added critical multimodal note
// - Updated image handling section
// - Removed image analysis from decision hierarchy
```

#### `/src/brain/orchestrator_functions/intentAnalyzer.ts`
```typescript
// Enhanced analyzeIntent function to:
// - Better detect and describe image content
// - Provide richer context without suggesting analysis tools
// - Communicate that tools handle images directly
```

#### `/src/server/services/data/projectMemory.service.ts`
```typescript
// Added new method:
async startAsyncImageAnalysis(
  projectId: string, 
  imageUrls: string[], 
  context?: string
): Promise<void>
// - Runs analysis in background
// - Stores results as memories
// - Never blocks main flow
```

#### `/src/server/api/routers/generation.clean.ts`
```typescript
// Updated endpoints:
// - sendMessage: Triggers async analysis when images present
// - Ensures analysis is fire-and-forget
// - Never affects tool selection or response time
```

### 4. Implementation Details

#### Image Analysis Flow:
1. User uploads image(s) with prompt
2. Router detects images and triggers async analysis
3. Intent analyzer provides visual context to brain
4. Brain selects appropriate tool (addScene/editScene) with imageUrls
5. Image analysis runs in background and stores context
6. Future requests benefit from stored image context

#### Key Principles:
- **Never Block**: Image analysis never blocks tool selection or generation
- **Context Only**: Analysis is purely for enriching project memory
- **Tool Independence**: Brain tools are multimodal and don't need analysis
- **Async Always**: All image analysis is fire-and-forget

### 5. Testing & Validation

#### Verified Scenarios:
1. âœ… Image upload with "create" prompt â†’ addScene selected with imageUrls
2. âœ… Image upload with "edit" prompt â†’ editScene selected with imageUrls
3. âœ… Multiple images â†’ All passed to appropriate tool
4. âœ… Background analysis completes and stores memories
5. âœ… No analyzeImage tool ever selected by brain

### 6. Impact & Benefits

1. **Improved Context**: Rich image understanding stored for future use
2. **No Latency**: Image analysis doesn't slow down generation
3. **Better Tool Selection**: Brain makes informed decisions with visual context
4. **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between tool selection and context building

### Completion Notes

This ticket successfully implements the async image analysis system while ensuring the brain orchestrator focuses solely on scene manipulation tools. The implementation provides rich context building without interfering with the core generation flow, meeting all requirements specified in the ticket.
