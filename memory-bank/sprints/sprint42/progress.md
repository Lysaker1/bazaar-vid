# Sprint 42 Progress

## Overview
Implementing unified architecture with standardized API responses and pure function tools.

## Completed

### TICKET-001: Generate Database-Driven Types ✅
- Created `/scripts/generate-types.ts` to generate TypeScript types from database schema
- Ensures `tsxCode` is the only valid field name (never code/existingCode/sceneCode)
- Integrated into build process via package.json scripts
- Generated types to `/src/generated/entities.ts`
- Updated tool types in `/src/tools/helpers/types.ts` to use correct field names
- Full documentation in `/memory-bank/sprints/sprint42/tickets/TICKET-001-PROGRESS.md`

### TICKET-002: Create Universal Response Format ✅
- Created `UniversalResponse` type definition in `/src/lib/types/api/universal.ts`
- Created `ResponseBuilder` helper class in `/src/lib/api/response-helpers.ts`
  - Replaced nanoid with built-in crypto.randomUUID() per user feedback
- Created client-side response handler in `/src/lib/api/client.ts`
- Created example router using UniversalResponse in `/src/server/api/routers/generation.universal.ts`
- Created comprehensive test suite in `/src/lib/api/__tests__/universal-response.test.ts`
- Full documentation in `/memory-bank/sprints/sprint42/tickets/TICKET-002-PROGRESS.md`

### TICKET-003: Refactor Tools to Pure Functions ✅
- Verified all tools (Add, Edit, Delete) are already pure functions with no DB access
- Fixed field name issues in edit helpers (using tsxCode instead of existingCode)
- Fixed router to pass correct EditToolInput fields
- Full documentation in `/memory-bank/sprints/sprint42/tickets/TICKET-003-PROGRESS.md`

### TICKET-004: Move Database Operations to Router ✅
- Created database service layer for all DB operations
- Created background task service for non-blocking operations
- Implemented clean router with UniversalResponse format
- Removed SceneBuilder (no backward compatibility needed)
- Full documentation in `/memory-bank/sprints/sprint42/tickets/TICKET-004-PROGRESS.md`

### TICKET-005: Enhance Brain for Smart Context Building ✅
- Updated BRAIN_ORCHESTRATOR prompt to remove image analysis tool selection
- Enhanced intent analyzer to better communicate about multimodal tools
- Added async image analysis method to projectMemory service
- Updated generation router to trigger async image analysis for context
- Image analysis is ONLY for context storage, never for tool selection
- Full documentation in `/memory-bank/sprints/sprint42/tickets/TICKET-005-PROGRESS.md`

### TICKET-006: Optimize ChatPanelG for Speed ✅
- Fixed API response handling to work with UniversalResponse format
- Added immediate loading feedback with dynamic messages
- Implemented image compression before upload (max 1920px, 85% quality)
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff (3 retries)
- Added performance tracking with duration display
- Added current operation display in UI
- Full implementation in `/src/app/projects/[id]/generate/workspace/panels/ChatPanelG.tsx`

## In Progress

Ready for next ticket!

## Pending

### TICKET-007: Real-time Preview Updates
### TICKET-008: Edit with Image Support  
### TICKET-009: Implement Smart Caching

## Notes
- User preferred not adding unnecessary dependencies (e.g., nanoid)
- Focus on making the system "idiot-proof" with consistent field names
- Fire-and-forget pattern for non-critical operations
- Image analysis runs async for context only - brain tools are multimodal
