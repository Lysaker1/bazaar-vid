├── use-mock-preview.ts
├── use-scene-crud.ts
├── use-template-insertion.ts
├── use-timeline-*.ts (5 files)
└── use-video-duration.ts
```

#### Unused Type Definitions (15 files)
```
/src/lib/types/
├── api/golden-rule-contracts.ts
├── canvas/
├── storage/
├── ui/
└── video/composition.ts, timeline.ts
```

#### Other Orphaned Files (23 files)
```
Various utilities, helpers, and standalone files with no imports
```

### 2. ACTIVE Files (118 files - Currently in Use)

#### Core Infrastructure (15 files)
```
/src/server/
├── api/root.ts
├── api/trpc.ts
├── auth/*
├── db/*
└── init.ts
```

#### Active Routers (11 files)
```
/src/server/api/routers/
├── generation.clean.ts ← NEW
├── project.ts, chat.ts, render.ts
├── voice.ts, feedback.ts, scenes.ts
├── share.ts, admin.ts, emailSubscriber.ts
└── generation.ts (still referenced by utils)
```

#### Active UI Components (45 files)
```
/src/app/ pages
/src/components/ used components
Active panel components (ChatPanelG, etc.)
```

#### Active Services & Tools (25 files)
```
/src/tools/ (all tool files)
/src/brain/orchestratorNEW.ts
/src/server/services/ai/openai.ts
/src/server/services/data/projectMemory.service.ts
```

#### Core Libraries (22 files)
```
Essential utilities, hooks, and stores actively used
```

### 3. TRANSITIONAL Files (27 files - Will be replaced)

These are currently used but will be replaced per Sprint 42:

```
/src/server/services/brain/contextBuilder.service.ts
/src/server/api/routers/generation.ts (after updating imports)
Various old service files still imported by brain
Old router implementations
```

### 4. TEST Files (25 files)

Test files throughout the codebase - need review to see which tests are still valid.

### 5. GENERATED Files (1 file)

```
/src/generated/entities.ts - Auto-generated from DB schema
```

## Deletion Summary

### Immediate Deletions (173 files)
All orphaned files can be deleted immediately with zero risk:
- No imports from any other files
- Not part of any active dependency chain
- Include entire unused features (templates, timeline, dashboard)

### After Migration (27 files)
Transitional files can be deleted after:
- Updating brain imports
- Completing ChatPanelG migration
- Moving remaining service logic

### Must Keep (144 files)
- All active files (118)
- Test files pending review (25)
- Generated files (1)

## Cleanup Commands

To delete all orphaned files safely:

```bash
# First, verify the list
node scripts/analyze-deps.cjs

# Then run the cleanup
node scripts/cleanup-orphaned-files.js

# Or manually delete specific categories:

# Delete unused components
rm -rf src/components/dashboard/
rm -rf src/components/timeline/
rm -rf src/components/editing/

# Delete all templates
rm -rf src/data/templates/

# Delete orphaned services
rm -rf src/server/services/scene/
# ... etc
```

## Impact Analysis

### Before Cleanup:
- 344 TypeScript files
- Complex, hard to navigate
- Many dead features

### After Cleanup:
- 171 TypeScript files (50% reduction!)
- Clean, focused codebase
- Only active features

### Benefits:
1. **Faster builds** - Less code to compile
2. **Easier navigation** - No confusion about what's used
3. **Clearer architecture** - Only active patterns remain
4. **Reduced maintenance** - No accidental work on dead code

## Verification Steps

After cleanup:
```bash
npm run typecheck  # Should pass
npm run build      # Should succeed
npm run test       # Review any failures
```

## Conclusion

This analysis reveals that **half the codebase is dead code**. The 173 orphaned files can be deleted immediately with confidence, as they have been verified through AST analysis to have no imports.

This is a much better result than the manual analysis - using proper tooling found 173 safe deletions versus the 17-20 I identified manually!
