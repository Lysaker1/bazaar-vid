# Sprint 11 Progress Tracker

## Ticket 1: Refactor Stream Processing in chatOrchestration.service.ts ✅ COMPLETE

**Implementation Summary:**

The core stream processing in `chatOrchestration.service.ts` has been refactored to properly handle OpenAI tool calls in streaming responses. This addresses the main issue where the system was detecting tool calls but failing to fully execute them.

**Key Changes:**

1. Added a new `ToolCallAccumulator` interface in `src/types/chat.ts` to properly type and structure tool call data across stream chunks
2. Replaced manual string accumulation and JSON parsing with structured data handling using OpenAI's `delta.tool_calls`
3. Implemented robust tool call accumulation by index across stream chunks
4. Added proper detection for when tool calls are complete based on `finish_reason: "tool_calls"`
5. Improved tool execution flow with proper tracking of executed tool calls to prevent duplicates

**Results:**

- The system now correctly extracts and accumulates tool calls from the stream
- Tool execution now triggers for scene planning and other tools
- Partial tool calls are properly accumulated into complete objects before execution
- The video generation pipeline should now properly execute when responding to user prompts

## Ticket 2: Enhance Error Logging and Debugging ✅ COMPLETE

**Implementation Summary:**

Added comprehensive logging, debugging, and performance tracking to make it easier to diagnose issues throughout the streaming process, specifically targeting tool call execution problems.

**Key Changes:**

1. Added structured logging with message ID tracking for consistent log correlation
2. Implemented performance metrics to track timing of key operations (stream parsing, tool execution)
3. Added detailed progress logging for tool call accumulation process
4. Created a metrics tracking object that summarizes key performance data at the end of processing
5. Added structured error handling with context-specific error messages and phases

**Results:**

- System now provides clear visibility into stream processing stages
- Easier to pinpoint where tool execution might be failing
- Performance metrics show potential bottlenecks in stream processing
- Error handling now captures and attributes errors to specific phases

## Ticket 3: Add Tool Call Event Buffer with Reconnection Support ✅ COMPLETE

**Implementation Summary:**

Implemented a robust event buffering system that enables seamless client reconnection and prevents data loss during connection interruptions, particularly important during long-running tool executions like video generation.

**Key Changes:**

1. Created a new `EventBufferService` class in `src/server/services/eventBuffer.service.ts` to store and manage stream events
2. Added new types to support event buffering, client tracking, and tool call state persistence
3. Implemented reconnection logic in `chatOrchestration.service.ts` with the `handleClientReconnection` function
4. Updated the chat router to use client IDs and support reconnection
5. Added mechanisms to track tool execution state and prevent duplicate tool executions on reconnection

**Results:**

- Clients can now reconnect and continue receiving events after temporary disconnections
- Tool execution state is preserved across reconnections
- System maintains buffer of previous events for efficient replay on reconnection
- Connection tracking helps detect and manage client states
- Automatic buffer cleanup prevents memory leaks from abandoned connections

**Next Steps:**

- Proceed with Ticket 4: Implement API Retry and Connection Resilience
- Consider updating client components to leverage the new reconnection capabilities

## Remaining Tickets:

- [ ] Ticket 4: Implement API Retry and Connection Resilience
- [ ] Ticket 5: Update Client-Side Stream Handling
- [ ] Ticket 6: Unit and Integration Tests for Stream Parsing
