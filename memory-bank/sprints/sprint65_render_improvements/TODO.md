# Sprint 65 TODO - Render Improvements

## Completed âœ…

- [x] Replace quality labels (high/medium/low) with resolutions (1080p/720p/480p)
- [x] Implement auto-download after render completes
- [x] Change 'export' terminology to 'render' throughout the UI
- [x] Fix download redirect issue (remove about:blank redirect)
- [x] Improve filename format to look less suspicious
- [x] Implement dynamic icon fetching with @iconify/utils
- [x] Fix avatar URLs in rendered videos
- [x] Fix resolution output - ensure quality settings actually change resolution

## Follow-up Tasks 

### High Priority
- [ ] Test icon rendering with various icon sets in production
- [ ] Add icon caching to reduce repeated fetches
- [ ] Monitor Lambda memory usage with new icon preprocessing

### Medium Priority  
- [ ] Add progress indication during icon preprocessing
- [ ] Implement retry logic for failed icon fetches
- [ ] Create icon usage analytics (which icons are most used)

### Low Priority
- [ ] Consider CDN for frequently used icons
- [ ] Add support for custom icon uploads
- [ ] Optimize SVG output (remove unnecessary attributes)

## Known Issues

1. **Google Fonts**: Still don't load in Lambda (separate issue from icons)
2. **Large Scenes**: Many icons could slow preprocessing
3. **Offline Usage**: Requires internet for icon fetching

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test each resolution output (480p, 720p, 1080p)
- [ ] Verify auto-download in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- [ ] Test with 10+ different icon sets
- [ ] Check avatar rendering in various scenes
- [ ] Verify filename format is consistent
- [ ] Test error cases (missing icons, network issues)

## Deployment Steps

1. Merge PR from `fix-render-icons-avatars` branch
2. Run `npm install` to get @iconify/utils
3. Test in staging environment
4. Monitor render performance metrics
5. Deploy to production

## Success Metrics

- Reduced support tickets about missing icons
- Improved render completion rate
- Positive user feedback on auto-download
- No performance degradation in render times
