# Sprint 55: Video Support - Progress Log

## January 25, 2025

### 10:00 AM - Initial Investigation
- User reported: "system just ignored the video"
- Video upload successful (13MB MOV file)
- Video URL properly stored in R2
- But system treated request as text-only generation

### 10:15 AM - Tracing the Issue
Added debug logging throughout the pipeline:
- ChatPanelG: ‚úÖ Correctly separating imageUrls and videoUrls
- SSE Route: ‚úÖ Passing videoUrls in response
- Generation Router: ‚úÖ Receiving videoUrls in userContext
- Orchestrator: ‚úÖ Detecting hasVideos: true

### 10:30 AM - Found the Break Point
```
üìù [HELPERS] Building ADD tool input: {
  hasVideoUrls: true,
  videoUrls: [...] 
}
üî® [ADD TOOL] Video URLs received: undefined  // ‚ùå Lost here!
```

The video URLs were being lost between helpers and the ADD tool.

### 10:45 AM - Root Cause Identified
The `BaseMCPTool` class uses Zod validation:
```typescript
const validatedInput = this.inputSchema.parse(input);
```

The `addToolInputSchema` didn't include `videoUrls`, so Zod was stripping it out!

### 11:00 AM - Implementation
1. Added `videoUrls` to `addToolInputSchema`:
   ```typescript
   videoUrls: z.array(z.string()).optional().describe("Video URLs for reference"),
   ```

2. Added `videoUrls` to `editToolInputSchema` for consistency

3. Also added missing fields that were in TypeScript interface but not in Zod schema:
   - `storyboardSoFar`
   - `referenceScenes`

### 11:15 AM - Testing Success! 
- Uploaded MOV file
- System recognized video
- Generated scene with Remotion Video component
- Text animations overlaid on video background
- Video playing properly with `volume={0}`

### 11:30 AM - Cleanup
- Fixed TypeScript errors (unused parameters)
- Added comprehensive documentation
- Created sprint documentation

## Key Learnings

1. **Zod Validation is Strict**: Fields not in schema are silently dropped
2. **Debug at Every Layer**: Helped pinpoint exact failure location  
3. **TypeScript != Zod**: Must keep schemas in sync with interfaces
4. **Test End-to-End**: Video worked in parts but not together
