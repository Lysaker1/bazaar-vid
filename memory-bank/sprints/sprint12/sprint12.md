Sprint 12: Implementing the Intelligent Animation Design Layer
Sprint Goal: To significantly enhance the quality and complexity of generated Remotion components by introducing an "Animation Design" step between scene planning and code generation. This involves creating a new LLM-powered service that translates a high-level scene description into a detailed animation brief, which then guides the Remotion code generation process.

Assumptions:

Sprint 11 (fixing tool call execution and streaming) is complete and functional.
The basic structure of scenePlanner.service.ts and componentGenerator.service.ts exists.
Epics & Tickets:
Epic 1: Define the "Animation Design Brief" Schema
Goal: Establish a clear, structured schema for the "Animation Design Brief." This brief will be the output of the new design step and the input for the enhanced component generation.

Ticket 1.1: Research & Define Animation Design Brief v1 Schema
Description: Research common animation principles, Remotion capabilities, and the types of details needed to generate rich visual effects. Define an initial JSON schema for the "Animation Design Brief."
Considerations:
Key visual elements (text, images, shapes, icons).
Animation properties (timing, easing, duration, sequence, delays).
Layout and positioning hints.
Color palette suggestions.
Typography suggestions (font family, weight, size).
Overall animation style (e.g., "minimalist," "energetic," "corporate").
Specific Remotion features to leverage (e.g., spring, interpolate, Sequence).
Deliverable: A JSON schema file (e.g., animationDesignBrief.schema.json) and markdown documentation for the schema.
Files to Create/Update:
memory-bank/schemas/animationDesignBrief.schema.json
memory-bank/api-docs/AnimationDesignBrief.md
Ticket 1.2: Define TypeScript Types for Animation Design Brief
Description: Create TypeScript interfaces based on the v1 schema for use throughout the application.
Deliverable: TypeScript file with the defined types.
Files to Create/Update:
src/types/animationDesign.ts (or similar)
Epic 2: Develop the "Animation Designer" Service
Goal: Create a new service that takes a scene description (from scenePlannerTool) and uses an LLM to generate the detailed "Animation Design Brief."

Ticket 2.1: Create animationDesigner.service.ts
Description: Set up the basic service file structure.
Deliverable: New file src/server/services/animationDesigner.service.ts.
Files to Create/Update:
src/server/services/animationDesigner.service.ts
Ticket 2.2: Implement generateAnimationDesignBrief Function
Description: This function will take scene.description, scene.durationInSeconds, scene.effectType, and other relevant context from the scene plan. It will then prompt an LLM to populate the "Animation Design Brief" schema.
Prompt Engineering: This is a critical step. The prompt needs to instruct the LLM to:
Thoroughly analyze the input scene description.
Break down the desired effect into specific visual and animation components.
Fill out all fields of the "Animation Design Brief" schema with rich, actionable details.
Suggest specific Remotion animation patterns or functions where appropriate.
LLM Choice: Use the appropriate OpenAI model (e.g., GPT-4o-mini or a more powerful one if budget allows for this crucial step).
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms.
Deliverable: Functional generateAnimationDesignBrief within the service.
Files to Update:
src/server/services/animationDesigner.service.ts
Ticket 2.3: Define a New LLM Tool: designAnimationForSceneTool (Optional but Recommended)
Description: Formalize the animation design generation as a dedicated LLM tool. This aligns with the existing architecture. The tool's parameters would be the inputs to generateAnimationDesignBrief (scene description, duration, etc.), and its output structure would be the "Animation Design Brief."
Deliverable: New tool definition in tools.ts.
Files to Update:
src/server/lib/openai/tools.ts
Epic 3: Integrate Animation Designer into the Scene Processing Flow
Goal: Modify scenePlanner.service.ts to call the new animationDesigner.service.ts after a scene is planned and before component generation is initiated for "custom" scenes.

Ticket 3.1: Modify handleScenePlan in scenePlanner.service.ts
Description:
After scenePlannerTool returns the initial scene plan.
If a scene's effectType is "custom" (or upgraded to "custom").
Instead of directly calling generateComponent with scene.description, first call animationDesigner.service.generateAnimationDesignBrief (or invoke the new designAnimationForSceneTool).
The resulting "Animation Design Brief" (not just scene.description) will then be passed to generateComponent.
Deliverable: Updated handleScenePlan function.
Files to Update:
src/server/services/scenePlanner.service.ts
Epic 4: Enhance Component Generator Service & Prompt
Goal: Update componentGenerator.service.ts to utilize the rich "Animation Design Brief" and significantly improve its internal Remotion code generation prompt.

Ticket 4.1: Modify generateComponent in componentGenerator.service.ts
Description:
Change the effectDescription parameter to accept the new "Animation Design Brief" object/structure.
Update the internal logic for deriving componentName if the brief provides better naming hints.
Deliverable: Updated generateComponent function signature and internal logic.
Files to Update:
src/server/services/componentGenerator.service.ts
Ticket 4.2: Overhaul the enhancedDescription (Remotion Code Gen Prompt)
Description: This is the core prompt engineering task for code quality. Replace the current enhancedDescription template with the much more detailed version discussed previously (see your notes from my earlier analysis).
This new prompt template MUST effectively use all the structured information from the "Animation Design Brief" (key elements, animation properties, styles, layout hints, color palettes, typography, etc.) to guide the LLM.
Key Focus Areas for the Prompt:
Instructing the LLM to translate each part of the design brief into specific Remotion code.
Reinforcing best practices (props, modularity, useCurrentFrame, interpolate, spring, Sequence).
Providing more sophisticated boilerplate examples if needed.
Guiding on error handling within the generated component (if applicable).
Deliverable: Updated enhancedDescription template string within generateComponent.
Files to Update:
src/server/services/componentGenerator.service.ts
Epic 5: Testing & Validation
Goal: Ensure the new pipeline generates significantly better Remotion code and functions correctly end-to-end.

Ticket 5.1: Unit Tests for animationDesigner.service.ts
Description: Write unit tests for generateAnimationDesignBrief, mocking LLM calls and verifying that valid "Animation Design Brief" objects are produced based on sample inputs.
Deliverable: Test files.
Files to Create/Update:
src/server/services/animationDesigner.service.test.ts
Ticket 5.2: Unit Tests for componentGenerator.service.ts (Prompt Construction)
Description: Write unit tests to verify that generateComponent correctly constructs the new enhancedDescription prompt using data from a sample "Animation Design Brief."
Deliverable: Test files.
Files to Create/Update:
src/server/services/componentGenerator.service.test.ts
Ticket 5.3: End-to-End Integration Testing
Description:
Manually test the full flow: User Prompt -> Scene Plan -> Animation Design Brief -> Remotion Component Code.
Use diverse prompts to create various scene types.
Critically evaluate the quality, correctness, and reusability of the generated Remotion code.
Verify that animations are smooth and match the intent of the design brief.
Check for common errors or anti-patterns in the generated code.
Deliverable: Test log and documented findings. Qualitative assessment of generated code.
Epic 6: Documentation Updates
Goal: Document the new architecture and services.

Ticket 6.1: Update System Architecture Documentation
Description: Update memory-bank/api-docs/Intelligent Video Creation Pipeline Documentation.md (or similar) to reflect the new "Animation Design" step.
Deliverable: Updated documentation.
Files to Update:
memory-bank/api-docs/Intelligent Video Creation Pipeline Documentation.md
Relevant diagrams.
Ticket 6.2: Document New Services and Schemas
Description: Ensure animationDesigner.service.ts and the "Animation Design Brief" schema are well-documented (code comments and potentially separate markdown files in memory-bank/api-docs).
Deliverable: Updated documentation.
Files to Update:
Code comments in new/updated services.
memory-bank/api-docs/AnimationDesignBrief.md (if not fully covered in schema docs).

Success Metrics for Sprint 12:

Demonstrable improvement in the quality, complexity, and correctness of generated Remotion components for "custom" scenes.
The new "Animation Design Brief" provides sufficient detail to guide effective code generation.
The system successfully integrates the new "Animation Design" step without breaking existing planning flows.
Developers can clearly trace the flow from scene description to animation design to generated code.
This plan provides a solid foundation for Sprint 12. It's ambitious but achievable if broken down and iterated upon, especially the prompt engineering aspects. Remember that prompt engineering is an art and science, so allow for several iterations to get the LLM to produce "great" animation designs and then "great" Remotion code from those designs.
