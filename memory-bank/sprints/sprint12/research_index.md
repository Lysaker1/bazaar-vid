# Research Index for Intelligent Animation Design (Sprint 12)

This document serves as an index to the key concepts and information found in the research documents related to implementing the Intelligent Animation Design layer. Its purpose is to facilitate quick reference and avoid the need to re-read entire documents.

## 1. Gemini Research Insights ([sprint12geminiresearch.md](cci:7://file:///Users/markushogne/Documents/APPS/bazaar-vid/bazaar-vid/memory-bank/sprints/sprint12/sprint12geminiresearch.md:0:0-0:0))

This document details the proposed Animation Design Brief schema and the rationale behind it.

*   **Animation Design Brief Schema:**
    *   **Description:** Comprehensive JSON schema for guiding LLM in generating detailed animation instructions. Includes fields for scene purpose, overall style, duration, color palette, typography, and element-specific animation properties.
    *   **Location:** Throughout [sprint12geminiresearch.md](cci:7://file:///Users/markushogne/Documents/APPS/bazaar-vid/bazaar-vid/memory-bank/sprints/sprint12/sprint12geminiresearch.md:0:0-0:0), with a detailed breakdown of fields and their purpose.
*   **Key Schema Components (Examples):**
    *   `briefVersion`, `sceneId`, `scenePurpose`, `overallStyle`, `duration`, `colorPalette`, `typography`, `audioTrack`, `elements` (with `elementId`, `elementType`, `content`, `initialLayout`, `animations`).
    *   **Location:** Sections describing each part of the schema in [sprint12geminiresearch.md](cci:7://file:///Users/markushogne/Documents/APPS/bazaar-vid/bazaar-vid/memory-bank/sprints/sprint12/sprint12geminiresearch.md:0:0-0:0).
*   **Rationale for Schema Design:**
    *   **Description:** Explains the thinking behind a structured brief to ensure clarity, consistency, and actionable detail for the LLM.
    *   **Location:** Introduction and concluding remarks in [sprint12geminiresearch.md](cci:7://file:///Users/markushogne/Documents/APPS/bazaar-vid/bazaar-vid/memory-bank/sprints/sprint12/sprint12geminiresearch.md:0:0-0:0).

## 2. OpenAI Research & Existing Animation Systems Insights ([sprint12openairesearch.md](cci:7://file:///Users/markushogne/Documents/APPS/bazaar-vid/bazaar-vid/memory-bank/sprints/sprint12/sprint12openairesearch.md:0:0-0:0))

This document explores how animation data is structured in existing tools like Lottie and Framer Motion, and general principles from OpenAI's function calling documentation.

*   **Lottie Animation Structure:**
    *   **Description:** Overview of Lottie JSON structure, including layers, shapes, keyframes, and expressions.
    *   **Location:** Section "Lottie Animation Data and Schema" in [sprint12openairesearch.md](cci:7://file:///Users/markushogne/Documents/APPS/bazaar-vid/bazaar-vid/memory-bank/sprints/sprint12/sprint12openairesearch.md:0:0-0:0).
*   **Framer Motion Concepts:**
    *   **Description:** Explanation of Framer Motion's animation variants, transitions, and component-based animation approach.
    *   **Location:** Section "Framer Motion Animation Data and Schema" in [sprint12openairesearch.md](cci:7://file:///Users/markushogne/Documents/APPS/bazaar-vid/bazaar-vid/memory-bank/sprints/sprint12/sprint12openairesearch.md:0:0-0:0).
*   **OpenAI Function Calling for Structured Output:**
    *   **Description:** Best practices for defining functions/tools to guide LLMs in generating structured JSON, relevant for the Animation Design Brief.
    *   **Location:** Implicitly through the context of generating structured data, and potentially referenced in relation to schema design.

## 3. Combined Insights & Best Practices

*   **Structured Data is Key:** Both research avenues emphasize the need for well-defined schemas (like the Animation Design Brief or Lottie JSON) to achieve predictable and useful outputs from either LLMs or animation rendering engines.
*   **Component-Based Animation:** The concept of elements/layers with individual animation properties is common across the proposed brief, Lottie, and Framer Motion.
*   **Temporal Control:** Explicitly defining duration, timing, and easing for animations is crucial.
