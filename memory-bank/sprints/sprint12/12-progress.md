## Sprint 12 Progress - Animation Design System

### Database Extensions for Animation Design Brief (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Created new `animationDesignBriefs` table in the database schema
- ✅ Created migration file for the database schema changes (0006_anime_design_brief.sql)
- ✅ Enhanced `animationDesigner.service.ts` to store design briefs in the database
- ✅ Added types and interfaces for the Animation Design Brief system
- ✅ Implemented robust error handling for LLM-based design brief generation
- ✅ Added process tracking with pending/complete/error status recording
- ✅ Created tRPC router (`animation.ts`) with these procedures:
  - `generateDesignBrief` - Creates a new brief using the LLM
  - `getDesignBrief` - Retrieves a brief by ID
  - `listDesignBriefs` - Lists all briefs for a project
  - `getSceneDesignBrief` - Gets a brief for a specific scene

### Benefits of the Animation Design Brief Database
- **Reproducibility**: Stores the exact design specifications that were used to generate components
- **Debugging Support**: Makes it easier to troubleshoot and iterate on component generation
- **Performance**: Avoids regenerating the same brief multiple times for the same scene
- **Analytics**: Enables tracking and analysis of design decisions and patterns
- **Caching**: Prevents unnecessary LLM calls for the same design requirements

### What Works
- Complete database storage pipeline for Animation Design Briefs
- Type-safe schema validation for all briefs
- Fallback handling with placeholder animations when LLM fails
- Proper error handling and status tracking

### What's Left for Sprint 12
- Integrate the Animation Design Brief with the Component Generator
- Create UI for viewing and editing design briefs
- Add support for reusing existing briefs as templates
- Implement the visual design system features from the research
- Create the client-side rendering components that use the design briefs
