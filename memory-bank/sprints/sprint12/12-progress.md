## Sprint 12 Progress - Animation Design System

### Database Extensions for Animation Design Brief (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Created new `animationDesignBriefs` table in the database schema
- ✅ Created migration file for the database schema changes (0006_anime_design_brief.sql)
- ✅ Enhanced `animationDesigner.service.ts` to store design briefs in the database
- ✅ Added types and interfaces for the Animation Design Brief system
- ✅ Implemented robust error handling for LLM-based design brief generation
- ✅ Added process tracking with pending/complete/error status recording
- ✅ Created tRPC router (`animation.ts`) with these procedures:
  - `generateDesignBrief` - Creates a new brief using the LLM
  - `getDesignBrief` - Retrieves a brief by ID
  - `listDesignBriefs` - Lists all briefs for a project
  - `getSceneDesignBrief` - Gets a brief for a specific scene

### Enhanced Component Generator Service Prompt (COMPLETED - Ticket 4.2)
- ✅ Completely overhauled the `enhancedDescription` prompt construction in `componentGenerator.service.ts`
- ✅ Structured the prompt with clear sections and explicit instructions for the LLM
- ✅ Implemented detailed guidance for translating `AnimationDesignBrief` elements into React/Remotion code:
  - Component structure and boilerplate that follows best practices
  - Element-by-element implementation guidelines based on `elementType`
  - Explicit CSS styling instructions for `initialLayout` properties
  - Step-by-step guidance for implementing animations with both `interpolate()` and `spring()`
  - Detailed translation of animation properties (timing, easing, transforms)
  - Audio tracks implementation
  - Sequence orchestration and timing relationships
- ✅ Added code quality best practices (modularity, performance, typing)
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript errors related to safe property access and array handling
- ✅ Optimized the prompt with concrete examples of Remotion patterns

### Benefits of the Animation Design Brief Database
- **Reproducibility**: Stores the exact design specifications that were used to generate components
- **Debugging Support**: Makes it easier to troubleshoot and iterate on component generation
- **Performance**: Avoids regenerating the same brief multiple times for the same scene
- **Analytics**: Enables tracking and analysis of design decisions and patterns
- **Caching**: Prevents unnecessary LLM calls for the same design requirements

### Unit Testing Infrastructure (IN PROGRESS - Tickets 5.1 & 5.2)
- ✅ Created test directory structure for services
- ✅ Wrote initial unit tests for `animationDesigner.service.ts`:
  - Testing database interactions for pending/complete/error states
  - Mocking OpenAI API calls and responses
  - Verifying error handling capabilities
- ✅ Wrote initial unit tests for `componentGenerator.service.ts`:
  - Testing job creation in the database
  - Verifying detailed prompt generation from `AnimationDesignBrief`
  - Testing status update functionality
- ❌ Encountered configuration issues with Jest and ES modules that need to be resolved
- ❌ Need to address TypeScript errors in test mocks related to service interfaces

### What Works
- Complete database storage pipeline for Animation Design Briefs
- Type-safe schema validation for all briefs
- Highly detailed LLM prompt for generating Remotion components from `AnimationDesignBrief`
- Initial test files for key services
- Fallback handling with placeholder animations when LLM fails
- Proper error handling and status tracking

### What's Left for Sprint 12
- Integrate the Animation Design Brief with the Component Generator
- Create UI for viewing and editing design briefs
- Add support for reusing existing briefs as templates
- Implement the visual design system features from the research
- Create the client-side rendering components that use the design briefs

### Enhanced `componentGenerator.service.ts` with Detailed Style and Layout Handling (In Progress)
- **Updated `animationDesignBrief.schema.ts`**:
    - Added `zIndex: z.number().int().optional().describe('Stacking order of the element')` to the `layoutSchema`.
    - **Reason**: To correctly include `zIndex` in the element layout definitions, which was previously missing and causing TypeScript errors in the component generator when trying to access it.
    - **Impact**: The schema is now more complete. TypeScript types derived from it will recognize `zIndex`, and validation will enforce its correct usage.
- **Refactored `getEnhancedDescriptionFromBrief` in `componentGenerator.service.ts`**:
    - Modified the logic to read style information from type-specific style objects (e.g., `element.styleText`, `element.styleImage`, `element.styleShape`) instead of a non-existent generic `element.style` property.
    - **Reason**: The `AnimationDesignBrief` schema defines styles in nested objects tailored to element types (e.g., `typographyStyleSchema` for text elements). The previous code was trying to access a generic `style` object on the element, leading to TypeScript errors and incorrect style processing.
    - **Impact**: The enhanced description sent to the LLM for component generation will now accurately reflect the specific styles defined in the brief for each element type. This should improve the quality and accuracy of the generated components.
- **Current Status & Next Steps for this item**:
    - The refactoring in `componentGenerator.service.ts` has resolved the errors related to the generic `style` property.
    - However, new TypeScript errors have appeared concerning the type-safe access to `styleText`, `styleImage`, and `styleShape` (e.g., `Property 'styleText' does not exist on type '{...}'`). This is likely due to TypeScript needing more explicit type narrowing for the discriminated union of `SceneElement`. This will be addressed next.
    - Separately, there are existing lint errors in `animationDesigner.service.ts` related to OpenAI API parameters that also need to be resolved.

## 2024-07-19: TypeScript Error Resolution and Schema Alignment

**Objective:** Resolve outstanding TypeScript errors in `componentGenerator.service.ts` and `animationDesigner.service.ts` to ensure robust integration of the Animation Design Brief.

**Changes Made:**

1.  **`componentGenerator.service.ts` Error Resolution:**
    *   **Issue:** Incorrectly attempting to access `element.styleText`, `element.styleImage`, `element.styleShape` which are not part of `elementSchema`.
    *   **Fix:** Removed the faulty logic. The enhanced description for the LLM now relies on properties directly available on the element and its `initialLayout`.
    *   **Issue:** Incorrect property names for animation details (e.g., `animation.type` instead of `animation.animationType`).
    *   **Fix:** Updated property access to match the `animationSchema` definition (e.g., used `animation.animationType`, `animation.durationInFrames`, `animation.delayInFrames`, and correctly iterated `animation.propertiesAnimated` for `from`/`to` values).
    *   **Impact:** Resolved all TypeScript errors in this file. The `getEnhancedDescriptionFromBrief` function now correctly reflects element and animation details based on the schema.

2.  **`animationDesigner.service.ts` Error Resolution (OpenAI Tool Parameters):**
    *   **Issue:** TypeScript errors (`Type 'ZodObject<...>' is not assignable to type 'FunctionParameters'`) due to passing an extended Zod object (from `animationDesignBriefSchema.openapi()`) to the OpenAI SDK's `tools.function.parameters`, which expects a plain JSON Schema.
    *   **Fix Attempt 1 (zod-openapi registry):** Tried using `OpenAPIRegistry` and `OpenAPIGenerator` from `zod-openapi`, but encountered module import errors.
    *   **Fix Attempt 2 (zod-to-json-schema - Successful):**
        *   Added `zod-to-json-schema` as a dependency (`npm install zod-to-json-schema`).
        *   Modified the service to import `zodToJsonSchema` and use it to convert `animationDesignBriefSchema` into a plain JSON Schema object.
        *   This JSON Schema is now used for the `parameters` in the OpenAI tool definition.
    *   **Additional Fix:** Corrected an unterminated block comment at the end of the file.
    *   **Impact:** Resolved TypeScript errors related to OpenAI tool parameters. The service now correctly defines the expected structure for the LLM to generate the animation design brief.

**Outcome:**
All previously identified TypeScript errors in `componentGenerator.service.ts` and `animationDesigner.service.ts` have been addressed. The system for generating and utilizing Animation Design Briefs should now be more type-safe and robust.

**Next Steps:**
*   Thorough testing of the `generateAnimationDesignBrief` and `getEnhancedDescriptionFromBrief` functionalities.
*   Continue with other planned enhancements for the animation system.
