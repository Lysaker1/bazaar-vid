# Project 1 Implementation Status - Sprint 24

This document provides a status update on the implementation of Project 1 tickets for Sprint 24, based on analysis of the current codebase.

## Ticket Status

### BAZAAR-243: Refactor chatOrchestration.service.ts
**Status**: In Progress (75% complete)

**Implemented components:**
- âœ… LLMService has been created and handles streaming from OpenAI
- âœ… ToolExecutionService has been converted to a class-based service with proper tool registration
- âœ… Breaking down large methods into smaller, focused helper functions
- âœ… Clear separation of concerns (message context fetching, stream handling, tool processing)
- âœ… Enhanced error handling and better typings

**Remaining work:**
- ðŸ”„ Create comprehensive unit tests for all services
- ðŸ”„ Add proper documentation for the new architecture
- ðŸ”„ Final integration testing with the frontend

### BAZAAR-244: Implement error recovery mechanisms
**Status**: In Progress (20% complete)

**Implemented components:**
- âœ… Basic error handling structure within the refactored services
- âœ… Improved error logging and reporting to client

**Remaining work:**
- ðŸ”„ Implement retry logic for failed requests
- ðŸ”„ Add timeout handling for long-running operations
- ðŸ”„ Implement circuit breakers for unreliable services
- ðŸ”„ Create recovery mechanisms for tool execution failures
- ðŸ”„ Add comprehensive testing for error scenarios

### BAZAAR-245: Enhance real-time feedback
**Status**: Not Started (0% complete)

**Remaining work:**
- ðŸ”„ Implement more granular progress indicators
- ðŸ”„ Add typing indicators and other visual cues
- ðŸ”„ Enhance SSE event structure
- ðŸ”„ Improve frontend handling of streaming events
- ðŸ”„ Add metrics for timing and performance tracking

## Overall Project 1 Status

Project 1 is approximately 30% complete for Sprint 24:

- **BAZAAR-243 (Refactor chatOrchestration.service.ts)**: 75% complete
- **BAZAAR-244 (Implement error recovery)**: 20% complete
- **BAZAAR-245 (Enhance real-time feedback)**: 0% complete

The refactoring of the chat orchestration service has made significant progress. The code is now better organized with proper separation of concerns between the LLM interaction, tool execution, and orchestration layers. This provides a solid foundation for implementing the remaining features.

Key achievements:
- Successfully extracted LLM functionality into its own service
- Converted tool execution from loose functions to a class-based service with proper tool registration
- Split the monolithic orchestration service into smaller, focused helper functions
- Improved error handling and logging across all services

Recommended next steps:
1. Complete unit tests for all refactored services
2. Implement retry logic and circuit breakers for error recovery
3. Begin work on real-time feedback enhancements
