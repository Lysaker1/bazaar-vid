# Project 1 Implementation Status - Sprint 24

This document provides a status update on the implementation of Project 1 tickets for Sprint 24, based on analysis of the current codebase.

## BAZAAR-243: Refactor chatOrchestration.service.ts

**Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED (25%)**

### Completed:
- ‚úÖ Created initial `LLMService` class in `src/server/services/llm/LLMService.ts` with basic streaming functionality
- ‚úÖ Set up proper exports in `src/server/services/llm.service.ts`
- ‚úÖ Created initial `toolExecution.service.ts` that extracts tool handlers from chat orchestration

### In Progress:
- üîÑ Integration of the new services into the main orchestration flow
- üîÑ Maintaining backward compatibility while refactoring

### Remaining Work:
- ‚è≥ Splitting scene planning and component generation into distinct flows
- ‚è≥ Improving error handling with structured error classes
- ‚è≥ Adding comprehensive tests for the refactored services
- ‚è≥ Full separation of concerns between LLM communication and tool execution

### Analysis:
The codebase shows initial steps toward refactoring with the creation of `LLMService` and `toolExecution.service.ts`. However, `chatOrchestration.service.ts` still contains most of the original logic, including stream processing and tool call handling. The refactoring appears to be in early stages with basic structures in place but not fully implemented.

## BAZAAR-244: Implement error recovery for component generation pipeline

**Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED (15%)**

### Completed:
- ‚úÖ Created basic `componentJob.service.ts` with checkpoint functionality
- ‚úÖ Implemented `saveCheckpoint` and `loadCheckpoint` functions

### In Progress:
- üîÑ Integration of checkpoint functionality into component generation pipeline

### Remaining Work:
- ‚è≥ Adding retry capability with backoff
- ‚è≥ Implementing manual job resumption
- ‚è≥ Providing detailed error context storage
- ‚è≥ Creating test cases for error conditions
- ‚è≥ Full integration with component generation workflow

### Analysis:
The scaffolding for checkpointing exists in `componentJob.service.ts`, but it's not yet integrated into the broader component generation pipeline. The functions for saving and loading checkpoints are implemented, but there's no evidence of retry logic, error context storage, or resumption capabilities.

## BAZAAR-245: Enhance real-time feedback during processing

**Status: NOT STARTED (0%)**

### Completed:
- ‚ùå No visible implementation in the codebase

### Remaining Work:
- ‚è≥ Implementing fine-grained progress events
- ‚è≥ Adding reconnection support
- ‚è≥ Updating UI components to show more detailed status
- ‚è≥ Adding integration tests for connection handling

### Analysis:
There is no evidence in the codebase of work on enhancing the granularity of SSE updates or improving reconnection support. The existing event buffer service is still being used without modifications for more detailed progress reporting.

## Overall Project 1 Status

**Implementation Progress: ~15%**

The Project 1 refactoring work for Sprint 24 has begun with basic implementations of some key services, but substantial work remains to be completed. The most progress has been made on extracting the LLM service and tool execution functions. Checkpoint functionality is partially implemented but not integrated. No visible progress has been made on enhancing real-time feedback.

### Recommendations:
1. Focus on completing the refactoring of `chatOrchestration.service.ts` first as it's the foundation for the other improvements
2. Integrate checkpoint functionality with the component generation pipeline
3. Begin implementation of enhanced SSE events after the core refactoring is stable
