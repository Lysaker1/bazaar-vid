# Sprint 24 Progress

## Current Status

As of the sprint initiation, we've identified the following status for the A2A system:

### What Works
- Basic agent registration via `src/server/services/a2a/agentRegistry.service.ts`
- Message bus infrastructure in `src/server/agents/message-bus.ts`
- API endpoints for accessing agents at `src/app/api/a2a/agents/[name]/route.ts`
- Task creation through `src/server/services/a2a/taskManager.service.ts`
- SSE stream management via `src/server/services/a2a/sseManager.service.ts`
- Basic UI for testing at `src/app/test/evaluation-dashboard/page.tsx`

### What's Broken
- Agent initialization stability (constant reinitializations)
- Message routing between agents (messages may not be reaching intended recipients)
- Excessive and unstructured logging making diagnosis difficult
- TaskProcessor lifecycle management
- Component generation reliability through the A2A pipeline

### What Needs Investigation
- Root cause of agent reinitialization cycles
- Proper singleton pattern implementation for services
- Logger configuration and transport setup
- Agent communication verification
- Message context preservation across agent handoffs

## Tasks In Progress

- [ ] Analyzing TaskProcessor initialization/shutdown patterns
- [ ] Reviewing message bus subscription and delivery mechanisms
- [ ] Investigating logger configuration options
- [ ] Prototyping improved agent status visualization

## Next Steps

1. **Agent Lifecycle Stabilization**
   - Implement singleton pattern for TaskProcessor
   - Create controlled shutdown sequence
   - Handle HMR gracefully

2. **Logging Improvement**
   - Standardize log formats
   - Implement log levels
   - Categorize logs by project/component

3. **Testing Framework**
   - Develop isolated agent testing
   - Create message bus verification
   - Implement end-to-end testing

4. **UI Enhancement**
   - Improve agent status visualization
   - Add communication flow diagrams
   - Implement real-time status updates

## Blockers

- Lack of clear visibility into agent initialization/shutdown cycles
- Difficulty interpreting current logs
- Uncertainty about message delivery between agents

## Updates

| Date       | Update                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2025-05-20 | Investigated cross-project logging issue. Verified `chatLogger` in `chatOrchestration.service.ts` is correctly derived from the main `logger` (source: 'main-app'). No direct misconfiguration found that would cause it to adopt A2A context. Issue might be more subtle (Winston internals, indirect A2A invocation, or Log Agent behavior). |
| 2025-05-20 | Resolved critical database schema mismatch for `bazaar-vid_custom_component_job` table. Applied migration `0009_smart_the_twelve.sql` by temporarily moving conflicting older migrations and using placeholder files. This fixed the `TRPCClientError: column "last_successful_step" does not exist`. Verified new columns are present. |
| 2025-05-20 | Updated all Winston loggers to emit JSON and route to the Log Agent |
| 2025-05-19 | Reviewed existing logs and added unified logging strategy guidance |
| 2025-05-19 | Initial test run executed: 32 suites failing, 13 passing |
| 2025-05-19 | Added EventBufferService and A2A utils tests, 15 suites passing |
| *Sprint Start* | Identified key issues and established sprint goals |

## Project 1 Progress Update (Standard Service Approach)

### BAZAAR-243: Refactor chatOrchestration.service.ts
- **Status**: In Progress (75% Complete)
- **Detail**: 
  - Extracted LLMService to handle OpenAI interactions
  - Converted toolExecution.service.ts to a class-based service with proper tool registration
  - Refactored chatOrchestration.service.ts to use the above services
  - Improved error handling and logging
  - Need to complete unit tests for new services
  - Need to enhance error recovery mechanism

### BAZAAR-244: Implement error recovery
- **Status**: In Progress (20% Complete)
- **Detail**:
  - Added foundational error handling structures in refactored services
  - Still need to implement proper retry logic
  - Need to add circuit breakers for handling service failures
  - Need to add comprehensive error reporting

### BAZAAR-245: Enhance real-time feedback
- **Status**: Not Started (0% Complete)
- **Detail**:
  - Will begin once BAZAAR-243 and BAZAAR-244 are further along

This document will be updated throughout the sprint to track progress and adjust priorities as needed.
