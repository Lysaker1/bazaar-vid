# Sprint 24 Progress

## Current Status

As of the sprint initiation, we've identified the following status for the A2A system:

### What Works
- Basic agent registration via `src/server/services/a2a/agentRegistry.service.ts`
- Message bus infrastructure in `src/server/agents/message-bus.ts`
- API endpoints for accessing agents at `src/app/api/a2a/agents/[name]/route.ts`
- Task creation through `src/server/services/a2a/taskManager.service.ts`
- SSE stream management via `src/server/services/a2a/sseManager.service.ts`
- Basic UI for testing at `src/app/test/evaluation-dashboard/page.tsx`

### What's Broken
- Agent initialization stability (constant reinitializations)
- Message routing between agents (messages may not be reaching intended recipients)
- Excessive and unstructured logging making diagnosis difficult
- TaskProcessor lifecycle management
- Component generation reliability through the A2A pipeline

### What Needs Investigation
- Root cause of agent reinitialization cycles
- Proper singleton pattern implementation for services
- Logger configuration and transport setup
- Agent communication verification
- Message context preservation across agent handoffs

## Tasks In Progress

- [ ] Analyzing TaskProcessor initialization/shutdown patterns
- [ ] Reviewing message bus subscription and delivery mechanisms
- [ ] Investigating logger configuration options
- [ ] Prototyping improved agent status visualization

## Next Steps

1. **Agent Lifecycle Stabilization**
   - Implement singleton pattern for TaskProcessor
   - Create controlled shutdown sequence
   - Handle HMR gracefully

2. **Logging Improvement**
   - Standardize log formats
   - Implement log levels
   - Categorize logs by project/component

3. **Testing Framework**
   - Develop isolated agent testing
   - Create message bus verification
   - Implement end-to-end testing

4. **UI Enhancement**
   - Improve agent status visualization
   - Add communication flow diagrams
   - Implement real-time status updates

## Blockers

- Lack of clear visibility into agent initialization/shutdown cycles
- Difficulty interpreting current logs
- Uncertainty about message delivery between agents

## Updates

| Date | Update |
|------|--------|
| *Sprint Start* | Identified key issues and established sprint goals |

This document will be updated throughout the sprint to track progress and adjust priorities as needed.
