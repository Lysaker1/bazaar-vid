# Testing Status Update for Sprint 24

## Progress Summary

We've made significant progress on the BAZAAR-260 ticket to improve the testing infrastructure. Here's where we stand:

### Completed Work

1. ‚úÖ **Analysis**: Completed a thorough analysis of the existing testing infrastructure
2. ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation on testing best practices
3. ‚úÖ **Infrastructure**: Created evaluation framework for LLM outputs
4. ‚úÖ **Test Harness**: Created example test harness for A2A testing

### Current Status

1. üîÑ **Module Resolution Fix**: Implemented a fix for the primary module resolution issue
   - Changed module imports to inline type definitions where needed
   - This approach works for simple tests but still needs more work for complex dependencies

2. üîÑ **Test Stability**: Improved test stability by:
   - Identifying "torn down environment" errors
   - Documenting proper test setup/teardown patterns

3. üîÑ **LLM Evaluation**: Implemented initial version of LLM output evaluation framework
   - Created basic metrics for content evaluation
   - Added code quality evaluation
   - Implemented specialized evaluators for different outputs (Remotion components, scene plans, agent responses)

## Current Status of Testing Initiatives

### 1. Module Resolution Fixes

- ‚úÖ Fixed module imports in `logger-transport.ts`
- ‚úÖ Resolved circular dependencies in test files
- ‚è≥ Working on standardizing module imports across codebase

### 2. Environment Teardown Issues

- ‚úÖ Added proper cleanup in agent tests
- ‚è≥ Implementing resource cleanup for database connections
- ‚è≥ Fixing event listener cleanup in SSE tests

### 3. Test Isolation

- ‚úÖ Created test harnesses for isolated component testing
- ‚è≥ Working on database isolation strategy
- üîÑ Need to identify more isolation issues

### 4. LLM Testing Strategy Implementation

- ‚úÖ Updated testing documentation to reflect dual LLM testing approach
- ‚úÖ Created metrics evaluation service for LLM output testing
- ‚úÖ Implemented initial A2A test harness with mock LLM responses
- ‚è≥ Setting up controlled environment for real LLM evaluation tests
- ‚è≥ Implementing comparison framework for different models (OpenAI vs Claude, o4-mini vs turbo)
- üîÑ Need to add tracking for response quality, speed, and cost metrics
- üîÑ Need to implement environment flags to control when real LLM tests run

### 5. Test Coverage

## Recent Test Runs

### Working Tests
- `src/app/__tests__/simple.test.ts`
- `src/server/workers/__tests__/simple.test.ts`
- `src/server/workers/__tests__/imports.test.ts`

### Partially Working Tests
- `src/server/services/__tests__/agentRegistry.service.test.ts` - 7/8 tests passing
  - Only failing on an assertion error (expected description differs)

### New Tests
- `src/server/services/evaluation/__tests__/metrics.service.test.ts` - 5/9 tests passing
  - Failures are related to scoring thresholds that need adjustment
  - Core functionality is working as expected

### Still Failing Tests
- Most A2A integration tests
- Most agent-related tests

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Module Resolution Issues**: ESM/CommonJS conflicts
   - TypeScript is configured for ESM but some imports use CommonJS patterns
   - Jest configuration has mixed module settings
   - The specific issue with `./types.js` imports was fixed by defining types inline

2. **Environment Teardown Problems**: Unclosed resources
   - Database connections are not properly closed
   - Async operations continue after tests complete
   - No proper cleanup in afterAll/afterEach hooks

3. **Test Isolation Issues**: Tests affecting each other
   - Global state is modified without cleanup
   - Tests rely on database state from previous tests

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Sprint 24)

1. **Standardize Module System**: Choose one module system for the entire project
   - Consider updating `tsconfig.json` and `jest.config.cjs` to be fully compatible
   - Update import statements throughout the codebase

2. **Fix Resource Cleanup**: Implement proper resource cleanup
   - Add proper `afterEach` and `afterAll` hooks to all tests
   - Ensure database connections are closed
   - Implement transaction wrapping for database tests

3. **Improve Test Harnesses**: Create specialized test harnesses
   - A2A test harness with proper mocking
   - LLM output evaluation test harness

4. Complete the dual LLM testing implementation
   - Finalize the metrics service for evaluating LLM outputs
   - Set up the controlled environment for model comparison
   - Implement tracking for response quality and performance metrics
   - Create a reporting system for prompt effectiveness

### Long-term Recommendations

1. **Test Organization**: Reorganize tests according to the proposed directory structure
2. **Integration Tests**: Implement proper isolation for integration tests
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Add tests to CI/CD pipeline
4. **Test Coverage**: Improve overall test coverage

## Conclusion

While we've made progress on understanding and fixing the testing infrastructure, there is still work to be done. The immediate focus should be on standardizing the module system and fixing resource cleanup issues. Once these foundational issues are resolved, we can move on to implementing more specialized testing harnesses and improving test coverage.

The evaluation framework we've implemented for LLM outputs provides a good starting point for testing the A2A system and other LLM-generated content. With some adjustments to the scoring thresholds, it will be a valuable tool for ensuring the quality of generated content.
