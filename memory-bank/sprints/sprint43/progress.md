# Sprint 43 Progress - Bazaar-Vid Architecture Refactoring

## Overview
Implementing intelligent brain architecture with simplified file structure and <30s generation time.

## Progress Log

### Day 1 - File Structure Cleanup

#### 1. Created Sprint 43 Documentation
- ✅ Created progress.md for tracking
- ✅ Reviewed approved plan in notes.txt

#### 2. File Cleanup Completed ✅
- ✅ Created cleanup analysis documenting all files to delete
- ✅ Created and executed cleanup script
- ✅ Removed duplicate brain implementations (15 files)
- ✅ Removed legacy service locations (2 files)
- ✅ Removed old router backup files (3 files)
- ✅ Moved scripts to root level
- ✅ Cleaned empty directories

**Results:**
- Before: 153 directories, 394 files
- After: 143 directories, 354 files (2 more removed after fixing imports)
- Removed: 10 directories, 40 files total

#### 3. Build Verification ✅
- ✅ Fixed broken imports in contextBuilder.ts
- ✅ Switched from generation.clean.ts to generation.universal.ts
- ✅ Removed unused generation routers
- ✅ Build now passes successfully
- [ ] Run tests to ensure nothing critical was removed
- [ ] Remove old scene services after verification

#### 4. Key Fixes Made
- Removed dependency on deleted ContextBuilderService
- Implemented inline image context building
- Switched to generation.universal.ts which uses direct DB operations
- Removed generation.clean.ts and generation.ts (duplicates)

#### 5. T3-Aware Cleanup Completed ✅
- ✅ Removed 85 orphaned files (kept sitemap.ts for SEO)
- ✅ Cleaned duplicate configurations and experiments
- ✅ Preserved T3 App structure (app/, server/, etc.)
- ✅ Kept workspace and all panels intact
- ✅ Restored templates (needed by TemplatesPanel)

**Final Results:**
- Before: 143 directories, 354 files
- After: ~125 directories, ~250 files
- Safely removed: ~100 files (mostly duplicates and experiments)
- Restored: Templates, UI components, evals (needed for build)

**Key Learning**: Many files that appear orphaned are actually needed:
- Templates used by TemplatesPanelG
- UI components have inter-dependencies
- Admin features use eval system

## Current State
- ✅ Build passes
- ✅ T3 structure preserved
- ✅ Duplicates removed
- ✅ Core pipeline intact: ChatPanel → Router → Brain → Tools

## Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 2: Implement intelligent brain/planner
2. Create new simplified prompts configuration (40+ → 5)
3. Remove layout JSON step for faster generation
