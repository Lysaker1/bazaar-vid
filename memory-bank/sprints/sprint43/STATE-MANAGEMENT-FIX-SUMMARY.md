# State Management Fix Summary

## Problem
Preview panel wasn't updating after add/edit operations, requiring a hard refresh.

## Root Cause
The response data extraction in ChatPanelG.tsx was looking at the wrong path. The UniversalResponse structure is:
```typescript
{
  data: scene,  // The actual scene data is HERE
  meta: { operation: 'scene.update' | 'scene.create' | ... },
  context: { chatResponse: '...', ... }
}
```

But the code was trying to access `responseData.data.data` (double nested).

## Fix Applied
1. **Corrected data extraction** (line 420):
   - Was: Looking for nested data
   - Now: `const actualScene = responseData.data;`

2. **Fixed TypeScript errors**:
   - Added null checks for undefined values
   - Fixed title field to have default value
   - Fixed string type checks in videoState.ts

## How It Works Now

### For Edit Operations:
1. User: "Make the text red"
2. Brain → Edit tool → Returns updated scene
3. generation.universal.ts returns: `{ data: scene, meta: { operation: 'scene.update' }}`
4. ChatPanelG receives response
5. Extracts scene from `responseData.data`
6. Calls `updateScene(projectId, sceneId, scene)` ✅
7. VideoState updates → PreviewPanelG re-renders automatically

### For Add Operations:
1. User: "Add a spinning logo"
2. Brain → Add tool → Returns new scene
3. generation.universal.ts returns: `{ data: scene, meta: { operation: 'scene.create' }}`
4. ChatPanelG receives response
5. Transforms scene to InputProps format
6. Updates entire props with new scene ✅
7. VideoState updates → PreviewPanelG re-renders automatically

## Key Points
- The state management flow was correct
- The issue was incorrect data extraction from UniversalResponse
- TypeScript helped identify the issue with proper types
- The single source of truth (UniversalResponse type) works as intended
