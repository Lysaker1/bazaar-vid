# Custom Component Loading Fix

## Problem Identified

We were consistently encountering errors with custom components not loading properly:

```
Error: Unexpected token '{'. import call expects one or two arguments.
[useRemoteComponent] Component loaded but __REMOTION_COMPONENT not found: 7bff90dd-a813-455e-9622-c2d7eb7fa36f
[CustomScene] Metadata fetch timeout for component 7bff90dd-a813-455e-9622-c2d7eb7fa36f after 5 seconds
```

The key issues were:

1. **Component Registration Failures**: The `window.__REMOTION_COMPONENT` was not being reliably set in all cases
2. **Script Execution Context Issues**: Simple assignments weren't reliably executing in the browser context
3. **React Element Type Errors**: Components not properly defined as functions/classes were causing rendering errors

## Root Cause Analysis

After examining the component loading pipeline:

1. The core issue was in how components were being registered in the global scope
2. Direct assignment (`window.__REMOTION_COMPONENT = ComponentName`) was unreliable 
3. The component template system wasn't using immediately-invoked function expressions (IIFEs) to ensure execution
4. Error handling was insufficient, resulting in failed components not providing useful fallbacks

## Implemented Solution

We made two critical changes to fix these issues:

### 1. Updated Component Template with IIFE

The `componentTemplate.ts` file was modified to use an IIFE for component registration:

```javascript
// Component implementation code...

// Register component using IIFE to ensure it executes reliably
(function() {
  try {
    // This is required - DO NOT modify this line
    window.__REMOTION_COMPONENT = {{COMPONENT_NAME}};
    console.log('Successfully registered component: {{COMPONENT_NAME}}');
  } catch(e) {
    console.error('Error registering component:', e);
  }
})();
```

This approach ensures:
- The registration code executes immediately after evaluation
- Errors are caught and logged instead of breaking the entire script
- The component variable is properly assigned to the global scope

### 2. Simplified Component API Route Processing

The `/api/components/[componentId]/route.ts` endpoint was updated to:

1. Simplify the template detection logic
2. Add more robust component registration for legacy components
3. Use IIFEs for all registration code blocks
4. Improve error handling for syntax errors
5. Provide better fallback components in error cases

The legacy component registration now uses this pattern:

```javascript
// Reliable component registration
;(function() {
  try {
    // Component registration logic here...
  } catch(e) {
    console.error('Error registering component:', e);
    // Fallback component code...
  }
})();
```

## Testing and Validation

The solution was tested with:

1. New components generated with the template system 
2. Legacy components from previous versions
3. Components with syntax errors to verify fallback behavior

Success criteria:
- Components load without console errors
- No more "Component not found" errors
- No React element type errors
- Proper fallback display on syntax errors

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Performance**: Watch for any loading time impacts from the additional code
2. **Template Refinement**: Continue to improve the template as needed
3. **Error Reporting**: Add more diagnostics for component loading failures
4. **LLM Prompt Updates**: Ensure the LLM is generating components compatible with our template system
