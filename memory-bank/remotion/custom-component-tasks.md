# Custom Component Implementation Checklist

This document provides a step-by-step checklist for the frontend team to implement and test the custom component system in Bazaar-Vid.

## API Routes Implementation

- [x] Create `/api/components/[componentId]` route
  - [x] Implement redirects to R2 storage
  - [x] Add proper error handling and logging
  - [x] Test with existing component bundles

- [x] Create `/api/components/[componentId]/metadata` route
  - [x] Return component metadata including ADB ID
  - [x] Add proper error handling and logging
  - [x] Test with existing component jobs

- [x] Create `/api/animation-design-briefs/[briefId]` route
  - [x] Implement ADB retrieval
  - [x] Add proper error handling and logging
  - [x] Test with existing ADBs

## tRPC Integration

- [x] Add `customComponent.getJobById` endpoint
  - [x] Include security checks for project access
  - [x] Return full job details with metadata

- [ ] Optimize tRPC queries for ADB retrieval
  - [ ] Add `customComponent.getAdb` endpoint that combines job and ADB fetch
  - [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed ADBs

## Frontend Components

- [x] Update the `CustomScene` component
  - [x] Add ADB fetching logic with metadata lookup
  - [x] Implement loading states with delayRender/continueRender
  - [x] Add comprehensive error handling

- [ ] Enhance `RemoteComponent`/`useRemoteComponent`
  - [ ] Add better error reporting
  - [ ] Implement script load timeout and retries
  - [ ] Add ability to cancel loading when component unmounts

## Image Handling Strategy

- [x] Implement Shape-Based Approach for Generated Components
  - [x] Modify LLM prompts to avoid generating image references
  - [x] Implement post-processing to replace any image tags with colored shapes
  - [x] Update ADB instructions to focus on animations without external assets

- [x] Create Documentation for Image Handling
  - [x] Document current approach in memory bank
  - [x] Add developer guidelines for reviewing components
  - [x] Create plan for future asset management implementation

- [ ] Test Image Handling Implementation
  - [ ] Verify generated components do not reference external images
  - [ ] Ensure animations work correctly with shape-based visual elements
  - [ ] Monitor edge cases where image references might still appear

## Testing Plan

- [ ] Unit Tests
  - [ ] Create tests for API routes with mock DB responses
  - [ ] Test CustomScene component with various states (loading, error, success)

- [ ] Integration Tests
  - [ ] Test complete flow from ADB to rendered component
  - [ ] Verify props passing from scene to component

- [ ] End-to-End Tests
  - [ ] Create test for complete pipeline from LLM to preview
  - [ ] Test error recovery

## Performance Optimization

- [ ] Component Loading
  - [ ] Implement preloading for upcoming components
  - [ ] Add caching for component bundles

- [ ] Rendering Optimization
  - [ ] Monitor and optimize component re-renders
  - [ ] Consider memoization for expensive calculations

## Additional Features

- [ ] Component Preview in Library
  - [ ] Create a component library view
  - [ ] Add ability to preview components in isolation
  
- [ ] Component Sharing
  - [ ] Implement component export/import functionality
  - [ ] Add ability to share components between projects

- [ ] Error Recovery
  - [ ] Create fallback components for failed loads
  - [ ] Implement automatic retry logic

## Documentation

- [x] Document the custom component pipeline
  - [x] Create flow diagrams
  - [x] Document API endpoints and data flow

- [x] Developer Documentation
  - [x] Document component requirements for LLM prompt design
  - [x] Create documentation for image handling approach
  - [x] Document troubleshooting steps

## UX Improvements

- [ ] Loading Indicators
  - [ ] Add visual feedback during component loading
  - [ ] Show progress indicators for multi-step operations

- [ ] Error Messages
  - [ ] Create user-friendly error messages
  - [ ] Add actionable error recovery options

## Future Asset Management System (Next Sprint)

- [ ] Plan Asset Upload Functionality
  - [ ] Design asset upload UI
  - [ ] Create backend routes for asset uploading to R2

- [ ] Asset URL Management
  - [ ] Create system for generating secure asset URLs
  - [ ] Design process for referencing assets in components

- [ ] Asset Preloading
  - [ ] Extend CustomScene to preload required assets
  - [ ] Implement asset caching strategy

## Deployment

- [ ] CI/CD Integration
  - [ ] Add tests to CI pipeline
  - [ ] Ensure API routes are properly deployed

- [ ] Monitoring
  - [ ] Add metrics for component loading times
  - [ ] Track error rates for component builds and loads
