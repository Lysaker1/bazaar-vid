# Timeline Implementation Comparison: Current vs. Professional RVE

This document compares our current timeline implementation with features typically found in professional React Video Editor (RVE) timelines. It serves as a guide for future development.

## Current Implementation

### Core Features
- Timeline grid with proper vertical tracks
- Draggable timeline items
- Basic zoom functionality
- Selection of items
- Status indicators for timeline items
- Integration with videoState store
- Proper type definitions for timeline items
- JSON patch operations for state updates
- Scene repositioning to prevent overlaps

### Timeline Item Types
- Text items
- Image items
- Video items
- Audio items
- Custom component items

### Basic Interactions
- Click to select
- Drag to move
- Basic resize functionality
- Timeline playhead

## Missing Professional Features

### Multi-Track Management
- Track locking to prevent edits
- Track groups for related content
- Custom track labels
- Track visibility toggles
- Track height customization
- Track headers with additional controls

### Timeline Navigation
- Improved scrubbing with preview
- Snapping to grid/other items
- Frame-by-frame navigation with keyboard
- Timeline markers/bookmarks
- Jump to specific timecode
- Zoom to selection/fit
- Multiple zoom levels with presets

### Advanced Timeline Operations
- Multi-select for batch operations
- Copy/paste with attribute preservation
- Time stretching
- Keyframe support for animations
- Visual representation of transitions
- Ripple edit (shift subsequent items)
- Slip/slide edits
- Nested sequences/compositions
- Split at playhead

### Performance Optimizations
- Virtualized rendering for large timelines
- Performance monitoring
- Efficient updates for large projects
- Lazy loading of thumbnails and waveforms
- Cached rendering of timeline items

### UI Enhancements
- Customizable appearance (colors, sizes)
- Context menus for quick actions
- Tooltips and help indicators
- History panel with undo/redo visualization
- Customizable keyboard shortcuts
- Minimap for large projects

### Timeline Item Enhancements
- Waveform visualization for audio
- Thumbnail strips for video
- Effect indicators and stacking
- Visual keyframe editors
- Duration/timecode display
- Item grouping and linking
- Opacity/visibility controls
- Link/unlink audio tracks

### Phase 3: Polish and Refinement (Lower Priority)
- [  ] Add context menus
- [  ] Implement customizable appearance
- [  ] Add tooltips and help
- [  ] Implement time stretching
- [  ] Add keyframe support
- [  ] Create transition editor
- [  ] Add nested sequences/compositions
- [  ] Implement history visualization

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Virtualization Strategy
For handling large timelines efficiently, we should implement:
- Window-based virtualization (only render items in view)
- Throttled updates during scrolling/zooming
- Canvas-based rendering for performance
- Efficient DOM recycling for item components

### Snapping Implementation
For precise timeline editing:
- Grid snapping with configurable intervals
- Item-to-item snapping with customizable snap distance
- Frame boundary snapping
- Keyboard modifier to temporarily disable snapping

### Performance Considerations
To ensure smooth timeline operation:
- Memoize timeline items to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Implement throttling for real-time operations
- Separate read/write operations to avoid layout thrashing
- Use CSS transitions where possible instead of JS animations

### Potential Libraries
Consider integrating these libraries to enhance timeline functionality:
- react-window or react-virtualized for virtual rendering
- interact.js for enhanced drag/resize functionality
- waveform-data for audio visualization
- immer.js for more efficient state management
