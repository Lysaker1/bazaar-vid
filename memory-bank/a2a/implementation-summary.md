# A2A Protocol Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the progress made on implementing Google's A2A protocol within the Bazaar-Vid platform. The implementation follows the phased approach outlined in the updated implementation plan, with a focus on maintaining compatibility with the existing agent system while gradually adding A2A protocol support.

## Implementation Status

### Completed Components

1. **Core Types & Interfaces** (`src/types/a2a.ts`)
   - Implemented A2A-compliant types for tasks, states, messages, and artifacts
   - Added helper functions for state mapping and message creation
   - Created utility functions for SSE events and structured messages

2. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Added A2A-specific fields to the customComponentJobs table
   - Created a new agent_messages table for inter-agent communication
   - Added migration script for schema changes
   - Updated custom indexes for efficient querying

3. **Task Lifecycle Management**
   - Implemented TaskManager service for A2A task state management
   - Added task creation, updating, and artifact management methods
   - Created JSON-RPC 2.0 API endpoint for A2A protocol compliance
   - Added SSE streaming endpoint for real-time task updates

4. **Agent Framework**
   - Created BaseAgent class for all agents to inherit from
   - Implemented message creation and task state management methods
   - Added agent card support for agent discovery
   - Created utilities for artifact creation and management

5. **Agent Discovery**
   - Implemented AgentRegistry service for agent registration and discovery
   - Added API endpoints for agent directory and individual agent cards
   - Created AgentCard interface following Google A2A specification

### In Progress Components

1. **Agent Integration**
   - Updating existing agents to inherit from BaseAgent class
   - Integrating TaskManager with existing agent messaging system
   - Updating state transition logic to use A2A task states

2. **tRPC Integration**
   - Adding A2A-compatible procedures to tRPC routers
   - Creating frontend hooks for A2A task management
   - Ensuring type safety across the frontend and backend

3. **Frontend Integration**
   - Developing React components for A2A status tracking
   - Replacing Pusher with SSE for real-time updates
   - Creating UI for task input requirements

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows a modular approach, where core components are implemented first, followed by integration with existing systems. This allows for incremental adoption of the A2A protocol while maintaining backward compatibility.

Key architectural decisions include:

1. **Decoupled Services**: TaskManager and AgentRegistry are implemented as standalone services
2. **Shared Type System**: All A2A types are centralized in a single file for consistency
3. **Protocol Adapters**: Helper functions translate between internal states and A2A protocol states
4. **Standardized Message Formats**: All inter-agent communication follows a structured format
5. **Real-time Updates**: SSE provides real-time updates for task status and artifacts

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps include:

1. **Update Coordinator Agent** to use the A2A task lifecycle
2. **Update Builder Agent** to create A2A-compliant artifacts
3. **Create tRPC procedures** for A2A task management
4. **Develop frontend components** for A2A task visualization

## Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Core Alignment)**: Mostly complete
- **Phase 2 (Agent Discovery)**: Partially complete
- **Phase 3 (Standard Message Types)**: In progress
- **Phase 4 (SSE Implementation)**: Partially complete
- **Phase 5 (Testing & Integration)**: Not started

The implementation is currently on track with the planned timeline, with approximately 60% of the core work completed.
