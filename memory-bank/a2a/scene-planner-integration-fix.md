# ScenePlannerAgent Integration Fix

## Problem Overview

The ScenePlannerAgent was not properly processing messages from the CoordinatorAgent despite all agents being correctly registered. The CoordinatorAgent was correctly sending CREATE_SCENE_PLAN_REQUEST messages to the ScenePlannerAgent, but:

1. The ScenePlannerAgent wasn't properly handling these messages
2. No communication was happening between these two agents 
3. Nothing was showing up in the UI or logs about scene planning activities

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the codebase, we found that:

1. The `ScenePlannerAgent` class was trying to use methods that didn't match the BaseAgent interface
2. The ScenePlannerAgent's `processMessage` implementation wasn't correctly handling the CREATE_SCENE_PLAN_REQUEST message type
3. The agent wasn't utilizing the existing `handleScenePlan` function from the scenePlanner.service.ts correctly

## Implementation Fix

We rewrote the ScenePlannerAgent implementation to:

1. Correctly handle CREATE_SCENE_PLAN_REQUEST messages from the CoordinatorAgent
2. Properly use the existing handleScenePlan function from scenePlanner.service.ts
3. Implement proper error handling and logging
4. Return appropriately formatted SCENE_PLAN_RESPONSE or SCENE_PLAN_ERROR messages

Key changes:
- Created a dedicated handleScenePlanRequest method
- Added detailed logging to track the agent's activities
- Ensured the agent updates task state appropriately
- Fixed parameters passed to the handleScenePlan function

## Testing

To test this fix:
1. Set DISABLE_BACKGROUND_WORKERS=false in your environment
2. Submit a new task with a prompt like "Create a short intro animation for a tech company called 'ballsie'"
3. Check the logs for ScenePlannerAgent activity
4. Verify the UI updates with scene planning progress

## Further Improvements

Potential future improvements:
1. Add more detailed status updates in the UI to show exactly what each agent is doing
2. Implement more robust error recovery if scene planning fails
3. Enhance the scene plan format to include more detailed animation guidance
4. Improve metrics for agent-to-agent communication efficiency
