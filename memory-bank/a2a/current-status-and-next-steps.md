# A2A Implementation: Current Status and Next Steps

## Current Status

The A2A (Agent-to-Agent) system has made significant progress with several key issues fixed:

1. **ScenePlannerAgent Integration**: Fixed the ScenePlannerAgent's message processing logic, enabling it to properly handle CREATE_SCENE_PLAN_REQUEST messages and generate scene plans.

2. **TaskProcessor Singleton Pattern**: Implemented a proper singleton pattern for the TaskProcessor to ensure only one instance exists throughout the application lifecycle, preventing duplicate agent registrations and multiple polling cycles.

3. **Logger Optimization**: Moved logger initialization to application bootstrap phase and implemented a singleton pattern for A2A file transport to prevent duplicate initializations.

4. **Agent Registration**: Consolidated agent registration to ensure all 7 required agents are properly initialized and registered with the task manager:
   - CoordinatorAgent
   - ScenePlannerAgent
   - BuilderAgent
   - UIAgent
   - ErrorFixerAgent
   - R2StorageAgent

5. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling and reporting throughout the system.

### What Works

1. **Task Creation via tRPC**
   - The `a2aRouter.createTask` procedure successfully creates tasks in the database
   - Tasks get correct initial state and metadata

2. **Task Management**
   - The `TaskManager` service correctly updates task status
   - SSE streaming for status updates is implemented and functional

3. **Agent Card Implementation**
   - Agent cards are correctly structured for discovery
   - UI components to display agent cards exist

4. **Message Protocol**
   - The message format following Google's A2A specification is established
   - Message structure for communication is well-defined

5. **UI Components**
   - Multiple visualization components are already built:
     - `AgentNetworkGraph.tsx`
     - `TaskTimeline.tsx`
     - `AgentCard.tsx`
     - `TaskDetailsPanel.tsx`

### What's Broken

1. **Task Processor**
   - Currently disabled via `DISABLE_BACKGROUND_WORKERS` environment variable
   - Multiple initializations causing potential race conditions

2. **Message Routing**
   - Messages to missing agents (like ScenePlannerAgent) fail to route
   - No fallback or error handling for missing agents

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Current test harness assumes all agents are registered
   - No simplified test environment for checking basic communications

## Key Fixed Issues

1. **TaskProcessor Reinitialization**: Fixed issue where TaskProcessor was being reinitialized on every request instead of functioning as a singleton.

2. **Logger Duplications**: Optimized logger setup to ensure file transports are only configured once during startup.

3. **Agent Communication**: Fixed the communication breakdown between CoordinatorAgent and ScenePlannerAgent.

4. **Message Processing**: Corrected ScenePlannerAgent's processMessage method to handle the CREATE_SCENE_PLAN_REQUEST message type properly.

## Integration Status

The A2A system is now able to progress beyond the initial task creation stage. The system properly routes messages to agents, processes them, and updates task states accordingly. The ScenePlannerAgent correctly generates scene plans based on task input, which is a critical step in the video generation pipeline.

## Recent Fixes (May 17, 2025)

### Logger Restart Fix

**Fixed Issues:**
- TaskProcessor was constantly being restarted due to the file watcher detecting log file creation/rotation
- SIGTERM events were occurring every 5-6 seconds, preventing message processing
- ScenePlannerAgent never had a chance to receive messages because the process was terminated too quickly
- The system was caught in an infinite restart loop

**Implementation:**
- Modified `initializeA2AFileTransport()` to use a configurable log directory with `A2A_LOG_DIR` environment variable
- Defaulted log directory to `/tmp/a2a-logs` (outside the watched tree)
- Added Next.js configuration to explicitly ignore log directories
- Implemented singleton pattern for the file transport to prevent duplicates

**Current Status:**
- The infinite restart loop is eliminated
- TaskProcessor remains stable between requests
- ScenePlannerAgent can properly receive and process messages
- Agents can communicate without interruption
- The A2A system can now progress beyond the initial task creation phase

**Next Steps:**
1. Continue testing the full A2A workflow with all agents
2. Set up proper environment variables for log directory in development and production
3. Verify that all agent communications work consistently
4. Monitor performance with the new logging configuration

See full documentation at [logger-restart-fix.md](logger-restart-fix.md)

### ScenePlannerAgent Integration Fix

**Fixed Issues:**
- ScenePlannerAgent not processing messages from CoordinatorAgent
- Missing scene planning functionality in the A2A workflow
- Communication breakdown in the agent pipeline

**Implementation:**
- Rewritten ScenePlannerAgent.processMessage() to properly handle CREATE_SCENE_PLAN_REQUEST messages
- Integrated with the existing handleScenePlan function from scenePlanner.service.ts
- Added comprehensive logging for better debugging
- Implemented proper task state updates and error handling

**Current Status:**
- The first two agents in the pipeline are now communicating properly
- Logs show correct message routing and processing
- Scene planning functionality is working

**Next Steps:**
1. Verify ADBAgent receives and processes the scene plan
2. Test end-to-end flow through all 7 agents
3. Enhance UI to display detailed agent activities
4. Add more robust error recovery mechanisms

## Next Steps

Following our [Implementation Fix Plan](./implementation-fix-plan.md), we need to:

### 1. Environment Configuration (1 hour)

- Create/update `.env.local` with:
  ```
  DISABLE_BACKGROUND_WORKERS=false
  A2A_DEBUG_MODE=true
  ```

### 2. Fix Agent Registration (2-3 hours)

- Consolidate agent registration into a single source of truth
- Modify `taskProcessor.service.ts` to use the proper registration system
- Implement singleton pattern to prevent multiple initializations
- Add debugging to show all available agents

### 3. Create Test Environment (3-4 hours)

- Implement a standalone test environment for A2A testing
- Create simplified MessageBus for local testing
- Register all agents locally for testing purposes
- Add UI controls to verify agent registration

### 4. Agent Implementation (1-2 days)

- Ensure all 7 core agents have basic implementations:
  - UserInteractionAgent (for initial prompt processing)
  - CoordinatorAgent (for orchestration)
  - ScenePlannerAgent (for scene planning)
  - ADBAgent (for Animation Design Brief generation)
  - BuilderAgent (for component generation)
  - ErrorFixerAgent (for error handling)
  - R2StorageAgent (for file storage)

### 5. Testing and Validation (1 day)

- Test the basic flow from user prompt → coordinator → scene planner
- Validate message passing between agents
- Confirm proper visualization in the agent network graph
- Test error conditions and edge cases

## Success Criteria

The minimum successful implementation for the first iteration should demonstrate:

1. User submits a prompt via the test dashboard
2. CoordinatorAgent receives the task and analyzes it
3. CoordinatorAgent routes to ScenePlannerAgent with appropriate context
4. ScenePlannerAgent processes the request and returns a response
5. The entire flow is visualized in real-time in the agent network graph

This proof-of-concept will validate our A2A architecture without requiring the full video generation pipeline to be implemented yet.

## Recent Improvements

- Implemented TaskProcessor singleton pattern to ensure consistent agent registration and message routing
- Fixed ScenePlannerAgent message handling to enable proper scene plan generation
- Optimized logger setup to reduce resource consumption and prevent duplicate initializations
- Enhanced agent initialization process for more reliable operation

The A2A system is now in a much more stable state, with the core communication infrastructure functioning as expected. The focus now shifts to validating the entire video generation workflow, ensuring each agent in the chain performs its specialized task correctly.
