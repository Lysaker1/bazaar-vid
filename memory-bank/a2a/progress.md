**Status:** In Progress
**Date:** 2025-05-16

### Documentation Phase (Completed)
**Implemented by**: Windsurf & Markus
**Files**:
- `/memory-bank/a2a/architecture-overview.md`
- `/memory-bank/a2a/message-protocol.md`
- `/memory-bank/a2a/database-schema.md`

**Summary**: Core SSE hooks and components implemented for real-time monitoring. Added task input handling, artifact display, and comprehensive task monitoring. Created integration testing harness to validate components with the backend.

## Next Steps (Markus)

1.  **Comprehensive Backend Integration & Advanced Testing (High Priority)**:
    *   [ ] Expand agent unit tests with more scenarios and edge cases (In Progress).
    *   [ ] Implement and test more complex inter-agent communication integration scenarios (e.g., ErrorFixer -> Builder success/failure, R2Storage flows including errors, full E2E success path from ADB to UI notification) (Actively Working).
    *   [ ] Rigorously verify A2A task lifecycle state transitions in all integration tests (Actively Working).
    *   [ ] Ensure artifacts are properly created, passed, and reported in integration tests (Actively Working).
    *   [ ] Test `input-required` state flow from backend perspective (Actively Working).
    *   [ ] Develop more comprehensive end-to-end (backend simulated) tests for the entire component generation lifecycle (Actively Working).

## Next Steps (Windsurf)

1.  **Validate `A2AIntegrationTest.tsx`**: Pull latest changes and ensure the test harness page functions correctly from UI to backend A2A flow.
2.  **Finalize `TaskStatusBadge`**: Confirm props (likely `status: A2ATaskStatus | null`) and ensure it displays all states correctly.
3.  **Implement Advanced UI Components**:
    *   Develop `TaskInputForm` for `'input-required'` state, including submission logic via tRPC.
    *   Create `ArtifactViewer` component to display different artifact types.
    *   Build a task list/dashboard component.
4.  **Complete Pusher to SSE Migration**: Systematically replace remaining Pusher instances with the new SSE hooks.
5.  **End-to-End UI Testing**: Test all user flows involving A2A tasks and real-time updates.

## Potential Challenges & Mitigations

1. **SSE Reconnection Handling**
   - Challenge: Ensuring clients can reconnect and resume streaming if the connection drops
   - Mitigation: Our implemented SSE Manager supports client reconnection with event IDs

2. **Task State Transition Complexity**
   - Challenge: Managing complex state transitions while ensuring consistency
   - Mitigation: Created type-safe state mappings between internal and A2A states

3. **Integration with Existing System**
   - Challenge: Maintaining backward compatibility with current components
   - Mitigation: TaskManager service is designed to work alongside existing component job system
