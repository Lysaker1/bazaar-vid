# A2A Progress

## Current Status (May 17, 2025)

### What Works

- ‚úÖ Basic A2A task creation and processing
- ‚úÖ Multi-agent communication system
- ‚úÖ SSE-based task status updates
- ‚úÖ Agent registry with discovery API
- ‚úÖ Routing of tasks to appropriate specialized agents
- ‚úÖ TaskProcessor singleton with proper lifecycle management
- ‚úÖ Stable development environment with fixed Next.js HMR issues
- ‚úÖ Logs redirected to /tmp to prevent development server restarts
- ‚úÖ A2A task execution flow with CoordinatorAgent -> ScenePlannerAgent path
- ‚úÖ Test dashboard for viewing agent interactions and task status

### What's Left to Build

- üî≤ Complete end-to-end video generation flow through all A2A agents  
- üî≤ Integration with BuilderAgent for TSX component generation
- üî≤ Integration with R2StorageAgent for asset hosting
- üî≤ User-facing project editor for A2A initialization
- üî≤ Error handling and recovery for failed tasks
- üî≤ Task resumption after server restart
- üî≤ Proper database persistence for task state
- üî≤ Metrics collection for A2A performance evaluation

### Known Issues

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Next.js dev server HMR triggers can cause TaskProcessor restarts (FIXED with latest scripts)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TaskProcessor script needs tsx installed globally (FIXED with auto-install in start-complete.sh)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Logs might still be written to both project directory and /tmp (FIXED with proper logger initialization)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Import path issues in TaskProcessor standalone script (FIXED with dynamic imports)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TSX module not found error when running standalone TaskProcessor (FIXED with auto-detection/installation)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some lingering TypeScript/ESLint errors that need addressing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to optimize OpenAI token usage with improved prompts

## Recent Fixes (May 17, 2025)

### HMR TaskProcessor Shutdown Fix

We've implemented a comprehensive solution to prevent Next.js HMR from constantly restarting the TaskProcessor:

1. **Enhanced Logger Configuration**:
   - All logs now properly use environment variables for directories
   - Logs are redirected to /tmp directories to prevent HMR triggers
   - Explicit initialization of A2A file transport

2. **Startup Script Improvements**:
   - Added TSX dependency check and auto-installation
   - Fixed Next.js 15 compatibility (removed --no-restart flag)
   - Created stable dynamic import system for TaskProcessor
   - Proper environment variable propagation

3. **Development Experience**:
   - Single command to start both Next.js and the TaskProcessor
   - Automatic termination of TaskProcessor when Next.js is closed
   - Better logging with clear indications of process state

### How to Run the System

Three options for running the A2A system:

1. **Option 1**: Simple polling-based stability
```bash
./scripts/startup.sh
```

2. **Option 2**: Running TaskProcessor separately
```bash
# Terminal 1
npm run dev:no-restart
# Terminal 2
./scripts/run-standalone-processor.sh
```

3. **Option 3 (RECOMMENDED)**: All-in-one script
```bash
./scripts/start-complete.sh
```

## Next Steps

1. Complete the ScenePlannerAgent implementation to generate proper scene plans
2. Integrate BuilderAgent for component generation
3. Implement R2StorageAgent for asset upload and hosting
4. Build UI interfaces for task submission and monitoring
5. Add error recovery and resumption capabilities
6. Improve test coverage for A2A components
