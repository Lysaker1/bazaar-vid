# A2A System Progress

## What Works

- Task creation through the A2A API
- Basic agent registry with multiple agent types
- Message Bus for inter-agent communication
- CoordinatorAgent routing
- Task persistence in database
- Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
- ScenePlannerAgent can process scene planning requests
- Integration with existing scene planner service

## Recent Fixes

- Fixed ScenePlannerAgent message bus connectivity issue
  - Added fallback mechanism when bus is undefined
  - Implemented robust error handling for message publishing
  - Added explicit validation of message bus connection
  - Created detailed logging of message bus operations
- Enhanced Debug Infrastructure
  - Improved diagnostic endpoint for ScenePlannerAgent
  - Better error tracking and logging
  - Framework for agent status checking
  
## What's Left to Build

- Complete BuilderAgent implementation
- End-to-end video generation workflow
- UI Agent for front-end interaction
- Real-time communication for agent messages
- Component management system integration 
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Monitoring dashboard for system health

## Current Status

The A2A system is partially functional. Task creation works, and agents can be registered and discovered. The CoordinatorAgent can route messages to appropriate specialized agents.

The ScenePlannerAgent can now process scene planning requests and properly communicate via the message bus (with fallback to direct responses if needed). Scene plans can be persisted in the database.

There are some build issues with the Next.js application that need to be resolved to complete full end-to-end testing.

## Known Issues

- Next.js vendor chunks missing, causing build errors
- Agent registry inconsistency between global registry and TaskProcessor
- Log filtering issues with the Log Agent
- Task processing might fail for specialized job types

## Next Steps

1. Fix Next.js build issues to enable full API functionality
2. Review agent initialization and registration flow
3. Implement end-to-end testing of the ScenePlannerAgent â†’ BuilderAgent workflow
4. Add monitoring dashboard for system health
5. Enhance error recovery for agent communication failures
