# A2A Logger System Fixes

## Summary

The A2A system was experiencing multiple issues related to the logging infrastructure, which were causing TypeScript linter errors and runtime failures. These issues have been addressed to ensure stable operation of the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) task processing pipeline.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Logger Method Compatibility**
   - The `a2aLogger` methods (`taskCreate`, `agentReceive`, etc.) were being used throughout the codebase but were not properly defined on the Logger type.
   - This caused TypeScript errors where properties like `a2aLogger.taskCreate` did not exist on type 'Logger'.
   - We updated the implementation to explicitly handle null task IDs by converting them to a string value ('unknown').

2. **Null Task IDs Handling**
   - Several places in the code were calling logger methods with null as the taskId (`a2aLogger.info(null, ...)`).
   - Modified the method signatures to accept `string | null` parameter types.
   - Added normalization of null taskIds to 'unknown' string value.

3. **Log Directory Configuration**
   - Ensured that the logger system properly respects environment variables for log directories, particularly:
     - `LOG_DIR` for general logs
     - `A2A_LOG_DIR` for A2A-specific logs
     - `ERROR_LOG_DIR` for error logs
     - `COMBINED_LOG_DIR` for combined logs
   - Added fallback to `/tmp/` directories when environment variables are not set.

## Start-complete.sh Script Fixes

1. **Removed Unsupported Flags**
   - The `--no-restart` flag used in the script is not supported in Next.js 15.
   - Updated to use environment variables (`WATCHPACK_POLLING=true CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true`) instead.

2. **Fixed Dependency Issues**
   - Instead of using dotenv, implemented a custom environment file parser that doesn't require external dependencies.
   - Added code to read .env and .env.local files directly using the Node.js fs module.
   - Fixed TaskProcessor initialization by using the correct getInstance() and initializePolling() methods.
   - Added fallback values for environment variables to ensure they're always set.

3. **Fixed Next.js Execution**
   - Changed direct `next` command to `npx next` to ensure it's found regardless of global installation.
   - Maintained environment variables when executing Next.js to ensure proper configuration.

4. **Simplified Standalone TaskProcessor**
   - Rewritten the standalone TaskProcessor script to avoid dependency issues.
   - Added proper error handling and logging for initialization failures.
   - Implemented healthcheck interval to ensure visibility into TaskProcessor operation.

## Runtime TaskProcessor Compatibility Enhancements

1. **TaskProcessor Initialization Fixes**
   - Fixed an issue where the TaskProcessor could not be properly initialized from the standalone script.
   - Included proper error handling and logging for initialization failures.
   - Used the correct singleton access pattern via getInstance() instead of direct construction.

2. **Signal Handling**
   - Improved handling of SIGINT and SIGTERM signals for cleaner shutdowns.
   - Ensured both Next.js and standalone TaskProcessor are properly terminated.

## Remaining Technical Debt

There are still some TypeScript linter warnings related to method redefinitions in the logger. These are primarily caused by:

1. Winston's Logger interface extensions not being fully compatible with the LeveledLogMethod return types.
2. Redefining standard methods like `error`, `warn`, `debug`, and `info` with custom signatures.

These issues do not affect runtime functionality but should be addressed in a future refactoring for code quality.

## Testing and Verification

To verify these fixes:

1. Run `./scripts/start-complete.sh` to start both Next.js and the TaskProcessor.
2. Check that logs are being written to the `/tmp` directories instead of the project directory.
3. Verify the TaskProcessor remains stable even when file changes trigger Next.js HMR.
4. Confirm that no restart loops occur and the system can process A2A tasks reliably.
