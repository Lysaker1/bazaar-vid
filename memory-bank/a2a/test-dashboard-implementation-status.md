## Not Started

### LLM Comparison Framework

- ‚è≥ Create diff viewer for code comparison
- ‚è≥ Add scoring system for evaluation
- ‚è≥ Develop metrics export functionality

### Advanced Agent Visualization
- ‚è≥ Add D3.js-based network visualization
- ‚è≥ Implement agent knowledge graph visualization
- ‚è≥ Add filters for message types and agent interactions

### Documentation and Testing
- ‚è≥ Create comprehensive user documentation for the dashboard
- ‚è≥ Add developer documentation for extending the dashboard
- ‚è≥ Implement tests for critical components

## Known Issues

1. **SSE Connection Management**:
   - The dashboard relies on SSE for real-time updates but doesn't have robust reconnection logic
   - Multiple tab instances can create duplicate SSE connections

2. **Component Integration**:
   - AnimationDesignBriefViewer needs Accordion UI component implementation
   - Type definitions for BadgeVariant need updating in CodeViewer

3. **API Consistency**:
   - tRPC query options need to be standardized across components
   - Some type definitions need to be shared between frontend and backend

## Next Steps

1. Update TaskCreationPanel to provide structured inputs matching backend expectations
2. Create ChatPanel component for the evaluation dashboard
3. Update the CoordinatorAgent to implement the full workflow
4. Enhance task status display with detailed step information

## Latest Updates

### SSE Connection Fixes (2025-05-17)

- Fixed infinite update loops in SSE connections using connection state tracking with useRef
- Added protection against rapid reconnections using throttling mechanisms
- Implemented smart reconnection logic to prevent duplicate connections
- Fixed "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors in AgentNetworkGraph and A2AIntegrationTest components
- Improved event source management to properly cleanup resources
- Added debug logging to trace connection lifecycle

To prevent the SSE connection issues, we implemented these key changes:

1. **Connection Tracking with useRef**
   - Added task ID tracking with useRef to maintain connection state independent of React renders
   - Prevented unnecessary reconnections to the same task
   - Improved cleanup on component unmount

2. **Throttling and Debouncing**
   - Added throttling to SSE message handling to prevent excessive state updates
   - Implemented debouncing for connection state changes
   - Set minimum intervals between processed messages

3. **Smart Reconnection Logic**
   - Added checks to prevent connecting to the same task multiple times
   - Improved disconnect/reconnect cycles when changing tasks
   - Added safeguards against race conditions during connection changes

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

### Dashboard Frontend Fixes

#### Enhanced SSE Connection Management (2025-05-17)
- **Problem**: Despite previous fixes, the A2A dashboard continued experiencing infinite loops and browser freezes due to SSE connection issues
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Insufficient connection state tracking and race conditions
  - The connection management system wasn't fully resilient against React's rendering cycles
  - Service worker interference was causing connection issues
  
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented a formal connection state machine with explicit states:
    - disconnected
    - connecting
    - connected
    - disconnecting
  - Added proper transition management with 500ms debouncing
  - Added service worker unregistration on component mount
  - Improved error handling for connection failures
  - Enhanced the connection display UI with clearer status indicators

#### SSE Connection Management Fix (2025-05-16)
- **Problem**: The A2A dashboard was experiencing infinite loops and browser freezes due to rapid SSE connection/disconnection cycles
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Event handlers were updating state without throttling, causing React to re-render too frequently
  - Connection management wasn't properly tracking component mount state
  - Multiple SSE connections to the same task were being created and destroyed in quick succession
  - Race conditions during connection state changes led to inconsistent behavior
  
- **Solution**:
  - Added event throttling to prevent rapid state updates (50ms minimum interval)
  - Implemented proper mounting state tracking with isMountedRef
  - Added connection tracking to prevent duplicate connections
  - Improved cleanup to prevent memory leaks
  - Fixed dependency arrays in useEffect hooks

## A2A Flow Analysis (2025-05-17)

### Current Implementation Issues

1. **Input Structure Mismatch**:
   - Frontend sends: `{ projectId, prompt, agentName }`
   - Backend expects: A complex payload with structured `targetAgent`, `effect`, and `message` objects
   - This mismatch may lead to incorrect initialization in the backend

2. **Orchestration Logic Gaps**:
   - The current CoordinatorAgent may not be implementing the complete workflow sequence
   - Missing clear transitions between:
     - Scene Planning
     - ADB Generation
     - Component Building
     - Evaluation/Build/Deploy
   - The sequence and handoffs between agents need improvement

3. **User Interaction Feedback**:
   - Missing dedicated UserInteractionAgent for providing continuous feedback
   - The test dashboard lacks a ChatPanel component for displaying rich conversation context
   - Users cannot see detailed progress for each workflow step

### Technical Implementation Plan

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix SSE connection stability (Completed)
2. **SHORT-TERM**: Align frontend-backend data contract 
3. **MEDIUM-TERM**: Implement the UserInteractionAgent and ChatPanel
4. **ONGOING**: Complete CoordinatorAgent workflow implementation
