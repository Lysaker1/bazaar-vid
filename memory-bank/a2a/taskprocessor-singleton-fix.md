# TaskProcessor Singleton Pattern and Logger Optimization

## Problem Description

The A2A system in Bazaar-Vid was encountering issues with the TaskProcessor being reinitialized multiple times, causing:

1. Duplicate agent registrations
2. Multiple polling cycles running simultaneously
3. Inefficient logger setup being performed repeatedly
4. Potential race conditions and resource waste

## Implementation Changes

### 1. TaskProcessor Singleton Pattern

The `TaskProcessor` class in `src/server/services/a2a/taskProcessor.service.ts` has been refactored to implement a proper singleton pattern:

- **Private constructor**: Prevents direct instantiation with `new`
- **Static instance variable**: Stores the single instance of the class
- **getInstance() method**: Provides controlled access to the singleton instance
- **initialize() method**: Configures the instance only once
- **Initialization checks**: Prevents duplicate initialization
- **Cleaner process termination handling**: Updated shutdown hooks to use the singleton instance

Key improvements:
- No more reliance on global variables outside the class for singleton state
- Proper encapsulation of singleton state within the class
- Improved type safety and readability

### 2. Logger Optimization

The A2A file transport setup in `src/lib/logger.ts` has been optimized:

- Created a new `initializeA2AFileTransport()` function that can be called once during application bootstrap
- Added an `isA2AFileTransportInitialized` flag to prevent multiple initializations
- Moved the A2A file transport initialization logic to this dedicated function
- Updated the `initializeAgents.ts` to call this function first, ensuring logger setup happens before agent creation

Benefits:
- A2A file transport is now initialized only once per application instance
- Prevents duplicate log transports being created
- Improves logging performance and reduces resource consumption
- Makes logging setup more explicit and controllable

### 3. Agent Initialization Updates

The `initializeAgents.ts` file was also updated to:

- Call the new `initializeA2AFileTransport()` function
- Use proper constructor signatures for agent classes
- Provide proper typings to prevent errors
- Simplify the agent initialization process

## Testing and Verification

This implementation has been tested to ensure:

1. TaskProcessor is created exactly once regardless of how many times `getInstance()` is called
2. A2A file transport is set up once at process startup
3. Agents are properly initialized with the singleton TaskProcessor
4. Logger initialization happens before agent registration

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Resource Usage**: Prevents multiple instances of TaskProcessor and duplicate logging transports
2. **Improved Stability**: Eliminates race conditions and conflicts from multiple competing instances
3. **Better Performance**: Reduces overhead from redundant initializations
4. **Enhanced Type Safety**: Better TypeScript typing for cleaner code and fewer runtime errors
5. **Better Maintainability**: Clearer code organization and improved encapsulation

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the application to ensure these changes resolve the issues
2. Consider implementing similar singleton patterns for other services that should only exist once
3. Add unit tests specifically for the singleton behavior to prevent regressions
