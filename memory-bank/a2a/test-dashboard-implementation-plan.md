- [ ] Add developer documentation for extending the dashboard
- [ ] Implement tests for critical components
- [ ] Test with different test cases and edge scenarios

## Component Task Dependencies

```
TaskCreationPanel
└── SSE Connection
    ├── AgentNetworkGraph
    │   └── AgentDirectory
    ├── AnimationDesignBriefViewer
    ├── CodeViewer
    └── RemotionPreviewPanel
```

## API Implementation Requirements

### New tRPC Procedures

1. [x] `a2a.getAgentDirectory` - Returns list of available agents with capabilities
2. [x] `a2a.getAgentActivity` - Returns agent activity for a specific task
3. [x] `a2a.getTaskDesignBriefs` - Returns animation design briefs for a task
4. [x] `customComponent.getComponentsForTask` - Returns all components for a specific task

### Extended SSE Events

1. [x] `agent_communication` - Real-time agent message passing events
2. [x] `agent_status_change` - Agent status updates (idle, working, error)
3. [ ] `brief_created` - Animation design brief creation notification
4. [ ] `component_status_change` - Component generation status updates

## Database Integration

The dashboard will leverage existing database tables:

1. [x] `agent_messages` - For tracking agent communications
2. [x] `customComponentJobs` - For component generation monitoring
3. [x] `animationDesignBriefs` - For design brief visualization

No new tables or schema changes are required for the initial implementation.

## Deployment Strategy

1. **Development Environment**: Implement and test in the development environment
2. **Limited Preview**: Deploy to staging for internal testing
3. **Full Deployment**: Merge to main branch for production deployment

## Success Metrics

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. [x] The dashboard provides real-time visualization of agent communications
2. [x] Users can create and monitor A2A tasks through the interface
3. [x] The system displays animation design briefs, TSX code, and rendered components
4. [ ] Performance metrics are collected and displayed for evaluation
5. [x] The interface works reliably across different browsers and screen sizes

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| SSE connection issues | High | Medium | Implement fallback polling mechanism |
| D3.js performance with large agent networks | Medium | Medium | Limit visible nodes, add pagination |
| Remotion component loading failures | High | High | Add robust error handling and fallbacks |
| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Low | Test across browsers, use polyfills |
| Data volume overload | Low | Medium | Implement lazy loading and pagination |

## Resources Required

1. D3.js for network visualization
2. Syntax highlighting libraries for code display
3. Remotion Player integration
4. UI component libraries (already using Shadcn UI)
5. SSE connection management

## Next Steps

1. [x] Begin implementation of Phase 1 tasks
2. [x] Create skeleton components for all major dashboard elements
3. [ ] Schedule regular progress reviews
4. [x] Prioritize core functionality over advanced features
5. [x] Document API requirements for backend team
