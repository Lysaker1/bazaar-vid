# Project Progress Overview

This file serves as the entry point for progress updates.
For details on how to maintain these logs see [progress-system.md](./progress-system.md).
Each sprint keeps its own `progress.md` under `/memory-bank/sprints/<sprint>/`.
Add short highlights here and detailed notes in the sprint files.

The first **200 lines** of this file should remain a concise summary of recent
work. When entries grow beyond that, move older sections to
`./progress-history.md` so the main file stays focused.

## Recent Highlights

**December 19, 2024: Homepage Hero Section Updated - Subheading & CTA Button ✅**
- **Updated subheading** from "Create stunning motion graphic scenes from a simple prompt" to "Bazaar is an AI-powered video generator that turns descriptions into animated motion graphics — in seconds."

  - Removed unused `prompt`, `placeholderText`, `useTypewriterPrompt` hook, and example prompts
  - Maintained existing project creation and routing logic
- **Result**: Simplified, conversion-optimized homepage that gets users to the generator faster

**December 19, 2024: Comprehensive UI/UX Improvements Reapplied ✅**
- **All major improvements from today's conversation have been successfully reapplied:**
  - ✅ **Storyboard icon commented out** in sidebar navigation (GenerateSidebar.tsx)
  - ✅ **Preview panel renamed to "Video Player"** in both PANEL_LABELS_G and quickActions
  - ✅ **Header consolidation in PreviewPanelG** - single header with hidden refresh button
  - ✅ **White background** applied to both PreviewPanelG and RemotionPreview components
  - ✅ **Auto-play functionality** enabled in RemotionPreview with `autoPlay={true}`
  - ✅ **Chat panel static behavior** - split auto-scroll logic to prevent post-completion scrolling
  - ✅ **Comprehensive message system** with local state, contextual completion messages, and no duplicates
  - ✅ **Scene creation vs update logic** properly implemented in backend with name preservation
  - ✅ **Unique component name generation** to prevent JavaScript identifier conflicts
  - ✅ **All routing fixed** - homepage, NewProjectButton, and /projects/new route to /generate
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Split auto-scroll into two useEffects: main effect stops when generation completes, completion effect scrolls once
  - Local message state prevents duplicates and provides immediate user feedback
  - Backend preserves scene names on updates, generates contextual titles for new scenes
  - Unique component naming system prevents "Identifier already declared" errors
- **Result**: Complete, modern video generation workspace with optimal UX and no technical issues

**December 19, 2024: Chat Panel Static Behavior After Scene Generation Complete ✅**
- **Prevented post-completion scrolling** - chat panel remains completely static once "Scene generated ✅" message appears
- **Split auto-scroll logic** into two separate useEffects:
  - Main effect: Scrolls during message changes and generation (but stops when complete)
  - Completion effect: Single scroll to show success message, then stops permanently
- **Eliminated flickering** - no further scroll adjustments, reflows, or movement after completion
- **Result**: Smooth, stable chat experience with no visual disruption after scene generation completes

**December 19, 2024: Fixed Homepage Form Routing to Updated UI ✅**
- **Problem**: Homepage prompt input form was routing users to legacy `/edit` interface instead of updated `/generate` UI
- **Root Cause**: `handleSubmit` function in homepage was hardcoded to redirect to `/projects/${projectId}/edit`
- **Solution**: Updated homepage form submission to route to `/generate` endpoint
- **Technical Changes**:
  - Modified `src/app/page.tsx` handleSubmit function
  - Changed redirect from `/projects/${projectId}/edit` to `/projects/${projectId}/generate`
  - Preserved all existing functionality including project creation with initial message
- **Result**: Users entering prompts on homepage now access the modern `/generate` workspace with chat panel, video player, and improved UX instead of legacy interface

**December 19, 2024: Fixed New Project Button Routing to Updated UI ✅**
- **Problem**: ➕ New Project icon in sidebar was routing to legacy `/edit` page instead of updated `/generate` UI
- **Root Cause**: Multiple routing points were hardcoded to redirect to `/edit` instead of `/generate`
- **Solution**: Updated all New Project routing to use `/generate` endpoint:
  - **NewProjectButton Component**: Changed redirect from `/projects/${projectId}/edit` to `/projects/${projectId}/generate`
  - **GenerateSidebar Collapsed Button**: Reverted to original ➕ icon but updated to use tRPC mutation and route to `/generate`
  - **Direct Route**: Updated `/projects/new` page redirect from `/edit` to `/generate`
- **Technical Changes**:
  - Modified `src/components/client/NewProjectButton.tsx` redirect route
  - Updated `src/app/projects/[id]/generate/workspace/GenerateSidebar.tsx` collapsed sidebar button to use tRPC API with ➕ icon
  - Fixed `src/app/projects/new/page.tsx` redirect destination
- **Result**: All New Project creation flows now correctly route to the updated `/generate` UI with chat panel, video player, and modern workspace interface. Collapsed sidebar maintains original ➕ icon appearance.

**December 19, 2024: Fixed Scene Creation vs. Update Logic & Preserved Scene Naming ✅**
- **Problem**: All prompts were being interpreted as scene updates, even when users intended to create new scenes. Scene names were being overwritten on updates.
- **Root Cause**: Overly aggressive edit detection logic and lack of name preservation in update operations
- **Solution**: Implemented proper scene creation vs. update decision layer:
  - **Explicit New Scene Indicators**: "create", "new scene", "generate", "build", "design" → always create new scenes
  - **Explicit Edit Indicators**: "make it", "change", "modify", "update", "fix", "adjust" → update existing scenes
  - **Context-Aware Logic**: No selected scene = new scene, short messages with selected scene = edit
  - **Scene Name Preservation**: Original scene names are preserved on updates, only generated for new scenes
- **Backend Changes**:
  - Modified `upsertScene()` to only update `tsxCode` and `props` for existing scenes, preserving `name`
  - Added `existingSceneName` tracking in edit mode
  - Updated scene data saving to use preserved names for edits
- **Frontend Changes**:
  - Improved `isLikelyEdit()` function with explicit indicators and better logic
  - Updated completion messages: "Scene generated: [title] ✅" vs "Scene updated ✅"
  - Removed aggressive edit detection that was causing false positives
- **Result**: Users can now reliably create new scenes with "create" prompts and edit existing scenes with modification prompts. Scene names remain stable once created.

**December 19, 2024: Fixed Duplicate Component Name Identifiers ✅**
- **Problem**: Error "Identifier 'Firework' has already been declared" when creating multiple scenes with similar prompts
- **Root Cause**: Scene generation was creating components with identical names (e.g., "Firework", "FireworkScene") causing JavaScript identifier conflicts
- **Solution**: Implemented unique component name generation system:
  - Added `generateUniqueComponentName()` function that extracts meaningful words from prompts
  - Fetches existing component names from database to ensure uniqueness
  - Appends numeric suffixes when needed (e.g., "FireworkScene", "FireworkScene1", "FireworkScene2")
  - Sanitizes names to ensure valid JavaScript identifiers
  - Updates LLM prompts to specify exact component name to use
  - Adds fallback replacement if LLM doesn't follow naming instructions
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Modified `generateSceneCode` endpoint in `src/server/api/routers/generation.ts`
  - Added database query to fetch existing component names before generation
  - Enhanced system prompts to include required component name
  - Added post-processing to ensure generated code uses correct name
  - Updated error fallback cases to use unique names
- **Result**: Each generated scene now has a guaranteed unique component name, eliminating JavaScript identifier conflicts

**December 19, 2024: Scene Generated Message Now Permanently Visible ✅**
- **Removed auto-hide timeout** for "Scene generated ✅" message - it no longer disappears after 3 seconds
- **Permanent chat history** - completion messages now remain visible in chat history until next generation starts
- **Improved user feedback** - users can see a clear record of all successful scene generations
- **Reset only on new generation** - completion status only resets when starting a new scene generation, not automatically
- **Result**: Clear, persistent record of scene generation success in chat history for better user experience

**December 19, 2024: Chat Panel UX Improvements - Auto-Scroll & Scene Generation Feedback ✅**
- **Added auto-scroll functionality** that automatically scrolls to show latest messages when:
  - New user messages are sent
  - System status messages appear
  - Scene generation starts or completes
  - Database messages are loaded
- **Improved scene generation feedback** with clear status progression:
  - "Generating scene..." with loading spinner during generation
  - "Scene generated ✅" with green checkmark when complete
  - Completion message shows for 3 seconds then disappears
- **Enhanced user experience** with smooth scrolling behavior using `scrollTo()` with `behavior: 'smooth'`
- **Added chat container ref** for precise scroll control and better performance
- **Result**: Users always see the latest messages and get clear, real-time feedback on scene generation progress

**December 19, 2024: Video Player Background Changed to White ✅**
- **Updated video player background** from dark gray (`bg-gray-900`) to white (`bg-white`)
- **Modified RemotionPreview component** to include `backgroundColor: 'white'` in Player style
- **Updated PreviewPanelG container** to use white background for consistency
- **Result**: Clean, bright white background for video player that provides better contrast and professional appearance

**December 19, 2024: Preview Panel Renamed to Video Player with Auto-Play ✅**
- **Renamed panel title** from "Preview" to "Video Player" in `PANEL_LABELS_G` and `quickActions`
- **Added auto-play functionality** to Remotion Player component with `autoPlay={true}` prop
- **Enhanced user experience**: Video now automatically starts playing when:
  - New scenes are generated
  - Scenes are updated or modified
  - Panel is refreshed or recompiled
- **Maintains existing features**: Loop, controls, volume, click-to-play, and fullscreen functionality preserved
- **Result**: More intuitive video player behavior that automatically shows generated content without manual play button clicks

**December 19, 2024: Preview Panel Header Consolidated ✅**
- **Removed redundant lower header** from `PreviewPanelG.tsx` that was cluttering the UI
- **Fixed refresh functionality** by adding hidden button with ID `refresh-preview-button-g` that upper header can trigger
- **Consolidated to single header** - only the upper header (matching other panels) is now visible
- **Preserved all functionality** - refresh button in upper header now works correctly
- **Cleaner UI** - Preview panel now has consistent styling with Chat and Code panels
- **Result**: Single, functional header with working refresh button that matches the design system

**December 19, 2024: Storyboard Icon Hidden from Sidebar ✅**
- **Commented out storyboard panel** from sidebar navigation in `GenerateSidebar.tsx`
- **Preserved workspace functionality**: Storyboard panel still works in workspace if added via other means
- **Easy restoration**: Code is commented out rather than deleted for quick restoration
- **Sidebar panels**: Now shows only Chat, Preview, and Code icons
- **Result**: Cleaner sidebar interface while maintaining backend storyboard functionality

**December 19, 2024: Storyboard Panel and Icon Restored ✅**
- **Restored storyboard panel** to sidebar navigation in `GenerateSidebar.tsx`
- **Restored storyboard to workspace** by updating `WorkspaceContentAreaG.tsx`:
  - Added back to `PANEL_COMPONENTS_G` and `PANEL_LABELS_G` objects
  - Added back to `quickActions` array in drop zone
  - Added back to `renderPanelContent` switch statement with correct props
  - Restored `StoryboardPanelG` import and `ListIcon` import
- **Result**: Storyboard panel is now fully functional and visible in the UI again
- **Panels available**: Chat, Preview, Storyboard, and Code panels all functional

**December 19, 2024: Storyboard Panel and Icon Hidden ✅**
- **Removed storyboard panel** from sidebar navigation in `GenerateSidebar.tsx`
- **Removed storyboard from workspace** by updating `WorkspaceContentAreaG.tsx`:
  - Removed from `PANEL_COMPONENTS_G` and `PANEL_LABELS_G` objects
  - Removed from `quickActions` array in drop zone
  - Removed from `renderPanelContent` switch statement
  - Removed unused `StoryboardPanelG` import and `ListIcon` import
- **Result**: Storyboard panel is now completely hidden from the UI while preserving all other functionality
- **Panels available**: Chat, Preview, and Code panels remain fully functional

**December 19, 2024: Storyboard Panel Changes Completely Reverted ↩️**
- **Full reversion completed** of all storyboard panel modifications after Add Scene button integration failed
- **WorkspaceContentAreaG.tsx**: Removed all storyboard-specific code including PlusIcon import, StoryboardPanelGHandle type, onAddScene prop, refs, handlers, and debugging code
- **StoryboardPanelG.tsx**: Reverted from forwardRef back to regular function component, removed useImperativeHandle, restored original internal header with Add Scene button
- **Current state**: Storyboard panel back to original double-header design with Add Scene button in internal header, no wrapper header integration
- **TypeScript errors**: Confirmed that existing TS errors are pre-existing configuration issues (JSX config, module resolution, missing dependencies) not related to the reverted changes
- **Development server**: Confirmed running properly at localhost:3000 despite TS configuration warnings

**May 27, 2025: Asset Management Utilities Added**
- Implemented `AssetAgentAdapter` and `LocalDiskAdapter` for handling uploaded and external assets.
- Enables basic cataloging of images, audio and video for generated storyboards.

**May 25, 2025: BAZAAR-257 Templates Updated**
- `componentTemplate.ts` now exports components via `export default` and drops
  the global registration IIFE.
- Added validation and tests to enforce this new pattern.
- `componentGenerator.service.ts` now includes `RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES` metadata
  for generated components.
- See [Sprint 25 Progress](./sprints/sprint25/progress.md) for details.

**May 21, 2025: CustomScene Component Tested & Validated**
- Successfully tested the rewritten CustomScene component using terminal-based testing tools
- Fixed import path issues with tilde (~) alias resolution when testing components
- Documented testing process and results in `/memory-bank/testing/results/custom-scene-test-results.md`
- Determined correct syntax for running component tests with environment variables: `dotenv -e .env.local -- tsx src/scripts/test-components/test-component.ts <input> <output>`

**May 21, 2025: Component Testing Tools Implemented**
- Created an integrated testing framework for Remotion components without database/R2 dependencies
- Implemented multiple testing approaches with varying levels of pipeline integration:
  - Component Test Harness: Uses actual DynamicVideo/CustomScene production pipeline

  - Terminal-based batch testing tools
- Comprehensive documentation added to `/memory-bank/testing/component-testing/`
- These tools enable rapid development, debugging, and LLM-generated component evaluation
- See [Integrated Testing Guide](./testing/component-testing/integrated-testing-guide.md) for full details

**May 25, 2025: BAZAAR-255 ESM Build Pipeline Migration Implemented**
- Successfully migrated the component build pipeline from IIFE format to ESM modules
- Removed global wrapping and window.__REMOTION_COMPONENT injection
- Updated external dependencies list to support React/Remotion imports
- Fixed TypeScript types for the buildLogger to support the implementation
- This is the foundation for the complete ESM modernization in Sprint 25

- *Details can be found in the relevant sprint log (e.g., [Sprint 24](./sprints/sprint24/progress.md) or `progress-history.md`).*

**May 17, 2025: Critical A2A TaskProcessor Stability Resolved**
- Fixed persistent Next.js HMR-induced restart loops that were destabilizing the TaskProcessor and A2A system. Achieved stability through a multi-pronged approach:
    - Enhanced Next.js & Webpack configurations (ignore patterns, polling).
    - Introduced new development scripts (`dev:no-restart`, `dev:stable`, standalone task processor).
    - Improved TaskProcessor resilience (true singleton, robust shutdown, instance tracking).
    - Corrected logger configurations (e.g., `buildLogger`, log file locations) to prevent HMR triggers.
- The A2A system, including ScenePlannerAgent, now operates reliably.
- *Details can be found in the relevant sprint log (e.g., [Sprint 24](./sprints/sprint24/progress.md) or `progress-history.md`).*

**December 19, 2024: Chat Panel Message Ordering & Contextual System Messages ✅**

- **Implemented chronological message ordering** - all messages (database + local) sorted by timestamp
- **Added contextual system messages** - completion messages now show "Scene generated: [prompt summary] ✅"
- **Eliminated dot placeholders** - no more "..." messages, all status messages are meaningful
- **Preserved final messages** - completion messages persist between interactions and remain visible
- **Enhanced message flow**:
  - User submits → message appears instantly
  - "Generating scene..." appears with loading spinner
  - "Scene generated: [context] ✅" appears on completion
  - Messages remain in chronological chat history
- **Improved visual feedback** - different colors for generating (blue), success (green), error (red)
- **Result**: Complete, coherent chat history with immediate feedback and contextual intelligence

**December 19, 2024: Chat Panel Static After Scene Generation Complete ✅**
- **Prevented post-completion scrolling** - chat panel remains completely static once "Scene generated ✅" message appears
- **Split auto-scroll logic** into two separate useEffects:
  - Main effect: Scrolls during message changes and generation (but stops when complete)
  - Completion effect: Single scroll to show success message, then stops permanently
- **Eliminated flickering** - no further scroll adjustments, reflows, or movement after completion
- **Removed duplicate scrolling** - eliminated manual scroll call from success handler to prevent conflicts
- **Result**: Smooth, stable chat experience with no visual disruption after scene generation completes

## Progress Logs

- **Main log**: `/memory-bank/progress.md` contains brief highlights and an index
  of sprint progress files.
- **Sprint logs**: Each sprint keeps a detailed progress file under
  `/memory-bank/sprints/<sprint>/progress.md`.
- **Special topics**: Additional progress files such as
  `/memory-bank/a2a/progress.md` or `/memory-bank/scripts/progress.md` are linked
  from the main log.

### Recent Updates (Top 200 lines - older entries to progress-history.md)

*   **Component Test Harness:** Integrated Sucrase for in-browser TSX to JS transpilation in `src/app/test/component-harness/page.tsx`. This should resolve dynamic loading issues and `useContext` errors. Added `inputProps` handling to `RemotionPreview` and `<Player>`.
*   **Component Harness:** Fixed another issue with Remotion component rendering in `src/app/test/component-harness/page.tsx`. We were incorrectly using the `component` prop instead of `lazyComponent` on the Remotion Player component. These are mutually exclusive props, where `component` expects a pre-loaded React component, while `lazyComponent` expects a function returning a dynamic `import()` promise, which is what our ESM-based approach requires.
*   **DB Analysis Toolkit**: Completed and debugged. Details in `memory-bank/db-analysis-toolkit.md` and `memory-bank/database-tools.md`.

# Bazaar-Vid Progress Log

## Latest Updates

### 2024-05-24: ESM Component Migration Complete

The ESM component migration has been completed successfully:

- Complete transition from IIFE format to ESM modules for all dynamically loaded components
- Implemented React.lazy for component loading with proper Suspense/error handling
- Updated component templates for ESM compatibility 
- Fixed dependency management with proper externals configuration
- Added comprehensive test coverage for the new ESM workflow

This work completes tickets BAZAAR-255, BAZAAR-256, BAZAAR-257, BAZAAR-258, and BAZAAR-260. The system now uses modern JavaScript module patterns and better integration with React's component model. 

See [Sprint 25 Progress](/memory-bank/sprints/sprint25/progress.md) for details.
### 2025-05-26: Documentation for ESM Components Updated
- Added new developer guide and updated integration docs. See [Sprint 25 Progress](./sprints/sprint25/progress.md).

### 2024-05-23: Sprint 25 Started - ESM Component Migration

Started work on transitioning custom components from IIFE format to ESM modules:

- BAZAAR-255: Updated build pipeline to output ESM modules
- Identified next steps for component loading mechanism (BAZAAR-256)
- Created test plan for ESM migration validation (BAZAAR-260)

### 2024-05-22: Sprint 24 Completed

All Sprint 24 tasks have been completed:

---

### Latest Updates - 2024-07-30

- **Component Harness:** Resolved 'Duplicate export of default' error (and associated infinite loop) in `src/app/test/component-harness/page.tsx`. The issue was caused by a redundant `export default MyComponent;` being added to the Sucrase-transformed code, which already included a default export. The fix ensures only a single default export is present in the code used for the dynamic import via Blob URL.

- **Component Harness:** Fixed another issue with Remotion component rendering in `src/app/test/component-harness/page.tsx`. We were incorrectly using the `component` prop instead of `lazyComponent` on the Remotion Player component. These are mutually exclusive props, where `component` expects a pre-loaded React component, while `lazyComponent` expects a function returning a dynamic `import()` promise, which is what our ESM-based approach requires.

# Progress Log

## 2024-12-19 - Chat Panel UX Improvements Phase 7: Dynamic Scene Title Generation

### Fixed Stale Scene Titles in System Messages
- **Problem**: System messages showed outdated scene titles like "Scene generated: Norwegian flag ✅" even for new prompts
- **Root Cause**: Completion message was searching through old `localMessages` to find user prompt, often finding stale data
- **Solution**: Added `currentPrompt` state to track the exact prompt being processed

### Enhanced Scene Title Generation
- **Improved `summarizePrompt` function**: Better word filtering and capitalization
- **Meaningful word extraction**: Filters out common action words and stop words
- **Proper capitalization**: Converts to Title Case for professional appearance
- **Length limiting**: Prevents overly long titles with 40-character limit
- **Fallback handling**: Graceful degradation when no meaningful words found

### Technical Implementation
- Added `currentPrompt` state variable to track active prompt
- Updated `handleSubmit` to store prompt with `setCurrentPrompt(trimmedMessage)`
- Modified completion message to use `summarizePrompt(currentPrompt)` instead of searching messages
- Enhanced word filtering with comprehensive stop word list
- Added proper Title Case formatting for scene names

### Example Improvements
**Before**: "Scene generated: Norwegian flag ✅" (stale/cached)
**After**: 
- "Scene generated: Rocket Launch Earth ✅"
- "Scene generated: Mobile Banking Dashboard ✅"
- "Scene generated: Travel Booking Interface ✅"

### Result
- ✅ Always shows current prompt-based scene title
- ✅ No more stale or cached scene references
- ✅ Professional Title Case formatting
- ✅ Meaningful word extraction for better titles
- ✅ Accurate reflection of just-generated content

## 2024-12-19 - Chat Panel UX Improvements Phase 6: Removed Toast Notifications

### Eliminated Bottom-Right Toast Notifications
- **Removed success toasts**: No more "Scene generated successfully!" or "Scene updated successfully!" notifications
- **Removed error toasts**: No more "Scene generation failed" or scene selection error notifications
- **Cleaner user experience**: Chat panel messages now provide all necessary feedback without redundant toasts
- **Simplified code**: Removed unused `toast` import from "sonner" package

### Rationale
- Chat panel already provides comprehensive visual feedback with status messages
- Toast notifications were redundant with the in-chat status updates
- Reduces visual noise and distractions during scene generation workflow
- Users get immediate feedback through the chat interface without additional popups

### Technical Changes
- Removed `toast.success()` call for scene generation/update completion
- Removed `toast.error()` call for scene generation failures
- Removed `toast.error()` call for scene selection validation
- Removed unused `import { toast } from "sonner"`
- Preserved all validation logic (scene selection check still returns early)

### Result
- ✅ No more bottom-right corner toast notifications
- ✅ All feedback now provided through chat interface
- ✅ Cleaner, less distracting user experience
- ✅ Maintained all error handling and validation logic

## 2024-12-19 - Chat Panel UX Improvements Phase 5: Clean User Messages & Correct Labels

### Hidden Internal Scene References from User View
- **Problem**: User messages displayed internal scene references like `@scene(ec1edfa9-92f0-4d12-98b4-d93221b25960) Make it look more like iran`
- **Solution**: Separated display message from processing message
  - User sees only their original input: `Make it look more like iran`
  - Internal scene reference `@scene(id)` used only for backend routing
  - `trimmedMessage` shown in chat, `processedMessage` sent to API

### Correct System Response Labels
- **Problem**: System always showed "Scene generated ✅" even when editing existing scenes
- **Solution**: Dynamic labeling based on operation type
  - **New scenes**: "Scene generated: [summary] ✅"
  - **Scene edits**: "Scene updated: [summary] ✅"
  - Uses `result.isEdit` from backend to determine correct label

### Enhanced Status Messages
- **Loading states**: Now show "Updating scene..." vs "Generating scene..." based on operation
- **Completion states**: Correctly labeled as "updated" or "generated"
- **User experience**: Clear distinction between creating new content vs modifying existing

### Technical Implementation
- Added `isEditOperation` detection in `handleSubmit`
- Updated user message storage to use `trimmedMessage` instead of `processedMessage`
- Modified completion message creation to use dynamic `actionLabel`
- Preserved all internal routing logic while cleaning user-facing display

### Result
- ✅ Clean user messages without internal metadata
- ✅ Accurate system responses ("updated" vs "generated")
- ✅ Consistent user experience across creation and editing workflows
- ✅ Maintained all backend functionality and scene routing

## 2024-12-19 - Chat Panel UX Improvements Phase 4: Duplicate Message Fix

### Fixed Duplicate User Messages and Trailing Placeholders
- **Problem**: User messages were appearing twice and "..." system messages appeared after completion
- **Root Cause**: Dual message systems - local state + video state + database refetching
- **Solution**: Simplified to single local message state system
  - Removed `initiateChatMutation` and `streamingMessageId` logic
  - Removed all `refetchMessages()` calls that caused database duplicates
  - Commented out database message fetching entirely
  - Updated `allMessages` to only use `localMessages`
  - Removed loading states and welcome message database dependencies

### Current Chat Flow (Fixed)
1. **User submits**: Message immediately appears in chat
2. **Generation starts**: "Generating scene..." appears with blue styling
3. **Generation completes**: Updates to contextual message like "Scene generated: travel booking app ✅"
4. **No duplicates**: Each message appears exactly once
5. **No placeholders**: No "..." messages ever shown

### Technical Changes
- `ChatPanelG.tsx`: Removed dual message system, kept only local state
- Messages now use `localMessages` state exclusively
- Eliminated all database message fetching and refetching
- Removed video state message updates that caused duplicates
- Simplified message flow to prevent any trailing placeholders

### Result
- ✅ Clean, immediate user message display
- ✅ Intelligent contextual completion messages
- ✅ No duplicate messages
- ✅ No trailing "..." placeholders
- ✅ Persistent chat history within session
- ✅ Proper chronological message ordering
