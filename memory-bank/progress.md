We're now preparing to implement the custom component generation pipeline (Sprints 5-6), which will allow users to request and generate custom Remotion effects using natural language. The implementation will include a database schema for custom component jobs, a build worker process using esbuild, R2 storage integration, dynamic component loading, and OpenAI function calling for generating TSX code.

We've implemented a robust Zustand state store (`videoState.ts`) that handles:
- Per-project state management of video properties
- Chat message history with optimistic updates
- Synchronization between client-side optimistic messages and database-persisted messages
- Patch application for real-time video updates

As part of Sprint 13, we've enhanced the Animation Design Brief system with improved UI integration:

### Completed Implementation (Sprint 13.3 - Scene Planning Panel Enhancements)

1. **Animation Brief Viewer in ScenePlanningHistoryPanel**
   - ‚úÖ Added collapsible Animation Design Brief sections for each scene
   - ‚úÖ Implemented read-only JSON view of the briefs with syntax highlighting
   - ‚úÖ Added status indicators (pending/complete/error) for tracking brief generation
   - ‚úÖ Created relationship visualization between scenes and their briefs
   - ‚úÖ Added timestamp tracking and version display

2. **Brief Generation Controls**
   - ‚úÖ Added "Generate Animation Brief" button for scenes without briefs
   - ‚úÖ Implemented "Regenerate" button for scenes with existing briefs
   - ‚úÖ Added visual feedback during brief generation (loading spinners)

3. **Fixed Animation Brief Schema Issues**
   - ‚úÖ Fixed OpenAI function calling schema to properly define required properties and structure
   - ‚úÖ Implemented proper fallback design briefs when generation fails
   - ‚úÖ Added proper scene ID validation to ensure UUIDs are correctly handled
   - ‚úÖ Enhanced error handling and reporting throughout the system

The Animation Design Brief system now provides:
- A structured way to generate detailed animation specifications
- UI controls to trigger, view, and manage briefs
- Persistent storage in the database
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Integration with the scene planning workflow

### Next Steps
- Finalize integration between Animation Design Briefs and component generation
- Explore visualizations for Animation Design Briefs (timeline, preview, etc.)
- Add ability to edit briefs manually before component generation

### Animation Design Brief System

#### What Works
- ‚úÖ Fixed the Animation Design Brief generation system to properly handle non-UUID descriptive IDs
- ‚úÖ Implemented a robust ID conversion system that automatically transforms descriptive IDs to valid UUIDs
- ‚úÖ Made the brief validation more flexible with optional fields and sensible defaults
- ‚úÖ Added support for alternative field naming conventions in the schema
- ‚úÖ Created an intelligent fallback mechanism to extract useful data from partially valid briefs
- ‚úÖ Updated LLM prompts to give clearer instructions about ID formats
- ‚úÖ Generation, storage and retrieval of briefs in the database
- ‚úÖ UI for displaying and regenerating briefs in the ScenePlanningHistoryPanel

#### What's Left to Build
- Visualization of the animation brief in a more user-friendly way
- UI for editing and customizing generated briefs
- Component generation based on the brief specifications
- Asset management for audio and images referenced in briefs
- Testing with more complex scene types and animation patterns

#### Current Status
- The Animation Design Brief system now works reliably and can handle various input formats from the LLM
- The system gracefully recovers from validation errors by creating usable fallback briefs
- OpenAI model correctly configured to use "o4-mini" 

#### Known Issues
- Some edge cases in animation properties validation may still need refinement
- Asset references (audio, images) need to be properly handled with the storage system

## Log Silencing Investigation (May 8, 2025)

- **Goal**: Reduce noisy terminal logs, specifically `fetchConnectionCache` and verbose tRPC GET requests.
- **Action 1**: Attempted to correct `next.config.js` for `serverComponentsExternalPackages` by moving it under `experimental`. This was based on older Next.js advice.
- **Action 2**: Corrected `next.config.js` again based on new warning: `experimental.serverComponentsExternalPackages` moved to top-level `serverExternalPackages`. Merged arrays.
- **Next Step**: Re-run `npm run dev:ultra-quiet` to observe current log output and determine if further adjustments to `server-log-config.js` are needed.

## Console Logging System Improvements

- Enhanced the console logging system to better filter noisy output from tRPC procedures
- Implemented three levels of filtering:
  - Standard mode (`npm run dev`) - Filters common tRPC logs
  - Ultra-quiet mode (`npm run dev:ultra-quiet`) - More aggressive filtering
  - Absolute silence mode (`npm run dev:silence`) - Maximum filtering, showing only critical errors
- Fixed issues with fetchConnectionCache deprecation warnings still appearing
- Added stronger pattern matching for API requests
- Created a new approach for reliable log filtering:
  - Added `filtered-dev.ts` script that filters logs at the process output level
  - Created new `npm run dev:clean` command using the script-based approach
  - Fixed incompatibilities between CommonJS and ES modules in utility scripts
- Created comprehensive documentation in `/memory-bank/api-docs/console-logging.md`
- Added marker utilities for creating logs that will never be filtered
- Implemented different performance thresholds based on filtering mode

## Sprint 14: Testing & UI Refinement (Current)

### Debug Findings - Component Generation Issues (May 10, 2025)

#### Core Issue Identified
- The TSX code is being successfully generated by the LLM and saved to the database (confirmed by logs and DB inspection)
- The build worker (`buildCustomComponent.ts`) fails with error "TSX code is missing for this job"
- Root cause: Likely issue with Drizzle ORM query in `buildCustomComponent.ts` not explicitly requesting the `tsxCode` field

#### Implemented Solutions
- Added explicit column selection to the database queries in `buildCustomComponent.ts` to ensure all required fields are fetched
- Added detailed diagnostic logging to check the fetched job data, including `tsxCode` presence and length
- Standardized the queries with proper column declarations to avoid potential field omission
- Updated the logging to track the data flow between component generation and build process 

#### Next Steps
- Monitor logs to confirm the fix resolves the issue
- Implement more comprehensive schema validation to prevent future mismatches
- Create database migration to ensure `tsxCode` field has correct type and indexing as needed

## May 10th, 2025 - Animation Design Brief (ADB) System Issues and Fixes

### Issues Found in Animation Design Brief Pipeline

1. **Missing OpenAI Client Module**: Discovered that `~/server/lib/openai/index.ts` was missing, causing import errors in `generateComponentCode.ts` which relied on importing the OpenAI client from this module.

2. **Component Job Processing Issues**: 
   - Generated jobs have valid TSX code in the database, but had status "building" with error "TSX code is missing for this job"
   - This indicated a disconnect between the component generation and the component build pipeline

3. **Jest Configuration Issues**:
   - Discovered issues with the babel-jest configuration that were causing test failures for ESM modules 
   - The configuration had unsupported assumptions that were causing dynamic imports to fail

### Fixes Implemented

1. **Fixed OpenAI Module Structure**:
   - Created the missing `~/server/lib/openai/index.ts` file exporting the OpenAI client correctly
   - This fixed the import errors in the component generation code

2. **Updated Jest Configuration**:
   - Fixed `babel.jest.config.cjs` to properly handle dynamic imports
   - Enabled `babel-plugin-transform-import-meta` for better ESM module support
   - Changed `modules` from "false" to "auto" to let babel determine module type

### Next Steps

1. **Testing Updates**:
   - Run the component generation tests again to verify that our fixes work
   - Address any remaining TypeScript errors in the test implementations
   - Improve test coverage for the Animation Design Brief pipeline

2. **Component Builder Enhancement**:
   - Verify the integration between component generation and building

## 2025-05-10: Fixed Custom Component Build Race Condition

### What's Working Now
- ‚úÖ Fixed race condition in component generation pipeline
- ‚úÖ Component jobs now properly save TSX code and trigger builds in correct sequence
- ‚úÖ Resolved "TSX code is missing for this job" errors by ensuring the build process is triggered after the code is saved

### What Was Fixed
- The build worker was fetching job records before the TSX code was saved to the database
- Modified `generateComponentCode.ts` to directly trigger `buildCustomComponent` after successfully saving TSX code
- Updated error handling in `buildCustomComponent.ts` to properly report errors

### Known Issues
- None at this time

## 2025-05-10: Custom Component Frontend Integration

- ‚úÖ API route `/api/animation-design-briefs/[briefId]` added to retrieve ADB data
- ‚úÖ Updated `CustomScene` component to fetch and pass Animation Design Brief data to components 
- ‚úÖ Added tRPC endpoint `customComponent.getJobById` to query component job details
- ‚úÖ Fixed race condition in component build process (see previous entry)

### Implementation Details
1. **Component Serving System**:
   - Components are built and stored on R2, with URLs saved in the `customComponentJobs` table
   - The API routes act as proxies, redirecting to the R2 URLs for JS files
   - API routes provide metadata and ADB data needed by the remote components

2. **Animation Design Brief Integration**:
   - `CustomScene` now fetches the animation design brief for a component
   - The brief is passed as a `brief` prop to the component
   - Implemented proper loading states with `delayRender`/`continueRender`

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Added comprehensive error handling for all API routes
   - Component loading/ADB fetching errors are displayed in the preview

### Next Steps
- Optimize data loading for ADB fetch, potentially using tRPC query hooks
- Add caching for component metadata and ADB data
- Further refine error handling and add retry logic
- Add documentation for component developers

## 2025-05-10: Implemented Image Handling Strategy for Custom Components

### What's Working Now
- ‚úÖ Modified LLM prompts to avoid generating components that reference external image files
- ‚úÖ Implemented comprehensive post-processing with robust regex patterns to remove image references
- ‚úÖ Updated Animation Design Brief instructions to focus on animations without external assets
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive documentation about this approach in `memory-bank/remotion/custom-component-image-handling.md`

### Implementation Details
1. **Shape-Based Approach**:
   - Instructed LLM to create components using only CSS-styled divs, SVG shapes, and text
   - Added sophisticated regex-based processing that:
     - Properly cleans import statements to remove Img and staticFile imports
     - Handles multiline patterns and complex JSX attributes
     - Removes any strings containing image file extensions
     - Replaces all image tags with colored divs that maintain animations
   - Replaced image elements with colored rectangles that still maintain the animation properties

2. **Temporary Solution**:
   - This approach focuses on getting animations working reliably first
   - Future sprints will implement proper asset management with R2 storage
   - Created documentation explaining the rationale and future implementation plans

3. **Documentation**:
   - Added developer guidelines for reviewing generated components
   - Documented the post-processing safeguards implemented
   - Created testing notes to help identify potential edge cases

### Next Steps
- Test the modified component generation with various scene descriptions
- Monitor effectiveness of the enhanced regex processing

## 2025-05-12: Fixed Component Build Failures Caused by Invalid JavaScript Names

### What's Working Now
- ‚úÖ Fixed component name validation to prevent esbuild syntax errors
- ‚úÖ All components now build successfully, even when LLMs suggest names starting with numbers (e.g., "3dModelsSpinScene")
- ‚úÖ More robust component generation pipeline with better error handling

### Implementation Details
1. **Component Name Sanitization**:
   - Added `sanitizeComponentName` function that ensures component names are valid JavaScript identifiers:
     - Cannot start with a number (prefixes with "Scene" if it does)
     - Only contains valid characters (letters, numbers, $ and _)
     - Is never empty (defaults to "CustomScene")
   - Applied to all places where component names are generated:
     - `componentGenerator.service.ts` (for components generated from ADBs)
     - `generateComponentCode.ts` (for components generated from LLM code)
     - `sceneAnalyzer.service.ts` (for component names from scene descriptions)

2. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Identified from logs that component names starting with numbers (like "3dModelsSpinScene") were causing esbuild syntax errors
   - These errors would prevent the component from being built and bundled, resulting in failed component jobs
   - LLMs often generate component names with numbers, especially for concepts like "3D", "2D", etc.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Added detailed documentation in `memory-bank/sprints/sprint15/component-name-validation.md`
   - Updated TODO-critical.md with information about the fix

### Next Steps
- Continue monitoring component builds for any other issues
- Consider adding more robust validation for other JavaScript syntax requirements in generated component code

- ‚úÖ Created missing API endpoint for Animation Design Briefs
- ‚úÖ Fixed component name sanitization to prevent esbuild errors with numeric names

### Implementation Details
1. **R2 SSL Issue Workaround**:
   - Modified `/api/components/[componentId]/route.ts` to proxy the R2 content instead of redirecting to it
   - This solves the SSL/TLS certificate issue with the R2 bucket
   - Added fallback to direct redirect if proxy fails

2. **CustomScene Improvements**:
   - Added detailed error handling and logging to all stages of component loading
   - Fixed useRemoteComponent to work better with CustomScene
