# Project Progress Overview

This file serves as the entry point for progress updates.
For details on how to maintain these logs see [progress-system.md](./progress-system.md).
Each sprint keeps its own `progress.md` under `/memory-bank/sprints/<sprint>/`.
Add short highlights here and detailed notes in the sprint files.

The first **200 lines** of this file should remain a concise summary of recent
work. When entries grow beyond that, move older sections to
`./progress-history.md` so the main file stays focused.

## Recent Highlights

**May 27, 2025: Asset Management Utilities Added**
- Implemented `AssetAgentAdapter` and `LocalDiskAdapter` for handling uploaded and external assets.
- Enables basic cataloging of images, audio and video for generated storyboards.

**May 25, 2025: BAZAAR-257 Templates Updated**
- `componentTemplate.ts` now exports components via `export default` and drops
  the global registration IIFE.
- Added validation and tests to enforce this new pattern.
- `componentGenerator.service.ts` now includes `RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES` metadata
  for generated components.
- See [Sprint 25 Progress](./sprints/sprint25/progress.md) for details.

**May 21, 2025: CustomScene Component Tested & Validated**
- Successfully tested the rewritten CustomScene component using terminal-based testing tools
- Fixed import path issues with tilde (~) alias resolution when testing components
- Documented testing process and results in `/memory-bank/testing/results/custom-scene-test-results.md`
- Determined correct syntax for running component tests with environment variables: `dotenv -e .env.local -- tsx src/scripts/test-components/test-component.ts <input> <output>`

**May 21, 2025: Component Testing Tools Implemented**
- Created an integrated testing framework for Remotion components without database/R2 dependencies
- Implemented multiple testing approaches with varying levels of pipeline integration:
  - Component Test Harness: Uses actual DynamicVideo/CustomScene production pipeline
  - Component Sandbox: Direct ESM component testing
  - Component Pipeline Visualizer: Step-by-step transformation view
  - Terminal-based batch testing tools
- Comprehensive documentation added to `/memory-bank/testing/component-testing/`
- These tools enable rapid development, debugging, and LLM-generated component evaluation
- See [Integrated Testing Guide](./testing/component-testing/integrated-testing-guide.md) for full details

**May 25, 2025: BAZAAR-255 ESM Build Pipeline Migration Implemented**
- Successfully migrated the component build pipeline from IIFE format to ESM modules
- Removed global wrapping and window.__REMOTION_COMPONENT injection
- Updated external dependencies list to support React/Remotion imports
- Fixed TypeScript types for the buildLogger to support the implementation
- This is the foundation for the complete ESM modernization in Sprint 25
- See [Sprint 25 Progress](./sprints/sprint25/progress.md) for implementation details.
**May 26, 2025: BAZAAR-262 Performance Benchmark Script**
- Added benchmark test comparing React.lazy import with script tag injection.
- Logs load times and memory usage.
- See [Sprint 25 Progress](./sprints/sprint25/progress.md) for details.


**May 24, 2025: BAZAAR-260 Test Scaffolding for ESM Migration**
- Updated server-side tests (`buildComponent.test.ts`) for ESM output verification.
- Created placeholder client-side test file (`CustomScene.test.tsx`) and noted existing `useRemoteComponent.test.tsx`.
- This lays the groundwork for comprehensive testing of the ESM migration.
- See [Sprint 25 Progress](./sprints/sprint25/progress.md) for details.

**May 25, 2025: BAZAAR-260 Docs Updated**
- Checklist and testing documentation updated for ESM migration.
- See [Sprint 25 Progress](./sprints/sprint25/progress.md).

**May 26, 2025: BAZAAR-263 Shared Module System Implemented**
- Introduced a shared module registry to allow utilities to be reused across custom components.
- Version information is tracked for each shared module.
- Documented usage in `memory-bank/sprints/sprint25/BAZAAR-263-shared-modules.md`.

**May 21, 2025: ESM Migration Planning Started**
- Detailed tickets written for Sprint 25 to convert dynamic components to ES modules.
- See [Sprint 25 Progress](./sprints/sprint25/progress.md) for more.

**May 20, 2025: Database Schema Corrected - Migration `0009` Applied**
- Successfully resolved a `TRPCClientError` caused by a missing `last_successful_step` column in the `bazaar-vid_custom_component_job` table. Migration `0009_smart_the_twelve.sql` was applied after a workaround for conflicting older migrations (moving them and using temporary empty placeholders).
- The database schema is now up-to-date with the application code, unblocking features dependent on the new columns.
- *Details in [Sprint 24 Progress](./sprints/sprint24/progress.md).*

**May 18, 2025: Message Bus Integration for A2A System**
- Implemented a new Message Bus architecture (singleton, feature-flagged with `USE_MESSAGE_BUS`) to significantly improve communication between A2A agents. CoordinatorAgent and UIAgent have been integrated, featuring enhanced error handling and performance monitoring.
- *Details can be found in the relevant sprint log (e.g., [Sprint 24](./sprints/sprint24/progress.md) or `progress-history.md`).*

**May 17, 2025: Critical A2A TaskProcessor Stability Resolved**
- Fixed persistent Next.js HMR-induced restart loops that were destabilizing the TaskProcessor and A2A system. Achieved stability through a multi-pronged approach:
    - Enhanced Next.js & Webpack configurations (ignore patterns, polling).
    - Introduced new development scripts (`dev:no-restart`, `dev:stable`, standalone task processor).
    - Improved TaskProcessor resilience (true singleton, robust shutdown, instance tracking).
    - Corrected logger configurations (e.g., `buildLogger`, log file locations) to prevent HMR triggers.
- The A2A system, including ScenePlannerAgent, now operates reliably.
- *Details can be found in the relevant sprint log (e.g., [Sprint 24](./sprints/sprint24/progress.md) or `progress-history.md`).*

## Progress Logs

- **Main log**: `/memory-bank/progress.md` contains brief highlights and an index
  of sprint progress files.
- **Sprint logs**: Each sprint keeps a detailed progress file under
  `/memory-bank/sprints/<sprint>/progress.md`.
- **Special topics**: Additional progress files such as
  `/memory-bank/a2a/progress.md` or `/memory-bank/scripts/progress.md` are linked
  from the main log.

### Recent Updates (Top 200 lines - older entries to progress-history.md)

*   **Component Test Harness:** Integrated Sucrase for in-browser TSX to JS transpilation in `src/app/test/component-harness/page.tsx`. This should resolve dynamic loading issues and `useContext` errors. Added `inputProps` handling to `RemotionPreview` and `<Player>`.
*   **Component Harness:** Fixed another issue with Remotion component rendering in `src/app/test/component-harness/page.tsx`. We were incorrectly using the `component` prop instead of `lazyComponent` on the Remotion Player component. These are mutually exclusive props, where `component` expects a pre-loaded React component, while `lazyComponent` expects a function returning a dynamic `import()` promise, which is what our ESM-based approach requires.
*   **DB Analysis Toolkit**: Completed and debugged. Details in `memory-bank/db-analysis-toolkit.md` and `memory-bank/database-tools.md`.
