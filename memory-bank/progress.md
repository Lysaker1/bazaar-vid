# Project Progress Overview

This file serves as the entry point for progress updates.
For details on how to maintain these logs see [progress-system.md](./progress-system.md).
Each sprint keeps its own `progress.md` under `/memory-bank/sprints/<sprint>/`.
Add short highlights here and detailed notes in the sprint files.

The first **200 lines** of this file should remain a concise summary of recent
work. When entries grow beyond that, move older sections to
`./progress-history.md` so the main file stays focused.

## Recent Highlights

**December 19, 2024: Homepage Hero Section Updated - Subheading & CTA Button ✅**

- **Result**: Simplified, conversion-optimized homepage that gets users to the generator faster

**December 19, 2024: Comprehensive UI/UX Improvements Reapplied ✅**
- **All major improvements from today's conversation have been successfully reapplied:**
  - ✅ **Storyboard icon commented out** in sidebar navigation (GenerateSidebar.tsx)
  - ✅ **Preview panel renamed to "Video Player"** in both PANEL_LABELS_G and quickActions
  - ✅ **Header consolidation in PreviewPanelG** - single header with hidden refresh button
  - ✅ **White background** applied to both PreviewPanelG and RemotionPreview components
  - ✅ **Auto-play functionality** enabled in RemotionPreview with `autoPlay={true}`
  - ✅ **Chat panel static behavior** - split auto-scroll logic to prevent post-completion scrolling
  - ✅ **Comprehensive message system** with local state, contextual completion messages, and no duplicates
  - ✅ **Scene creation vs update logic** properly implemented in backend with name preservation
  - ✅ **Unique component name generation** to prevent JavaScript identifier conflicts
  - ✅ **All routing fixed** - homepage, NewProjectButton, and /projects/new route to /generate
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Split auto-scroll into two useEffects: main effect stops when generation completes, completion effect scrolls once
  - Local message state prevents duplicates and provides immediate user feedback
  - Backend preserves scene names on updates, generates contextual titles for new scenes
  - Unique component naming system prevents "Identifier already declared" errors
- **Result**: Complete, modern video generation workspace with optimal UX and no technical issues

**December 19, 2024: Chat Panel Static Behavior After Scene Generation Complete ✅**
- **Prevented post-completion scrolling** - chat panel remains completely static once "Scene generated ✅" message appears
- **Split auto-scroll logic** into two separate useEffects:
  - Main effect: Scrolls during message changes and generation (but stops when complete)
  - Completion effect: Single scroll to show success message, then stops permanently
- **Eliminated flickering** - no further scroll adjustments, reflows, or movement after completion
- **Result**: Smooth, stable chat experience with no visual disruption after scene generation completes

**December 19, 2024: Fixed Homepage Form Routing to Updated UI ✅**
- **Problem**: Homepage prompt input form was routing users to legacy `/edit` interface instead of updated `/generate` UI
- **Root Cause**: `handleSubmit` function in homepage was hardcoded to redirect to `/projects/${projectId}/edit`
- **Solution**: Updated homepage form submission to route to `/generate` endpoint
- **Technical Changes**:
  - Modified `src/app/page.tsx` handleSubmit function
  - Changed redirect from `/projects/${projectId}/edit` to `/projects/${projectId}/generate`
  - Preserved all existing functionality including project creation with initial message
- **Result**: Users entering prompts on homepage now access the modern `/generate` workspace with chat panel, video player, and improved UX instead of legacy interface

**December 19, 2024: Fixed New Project Button Routing to Updated UI ✅**
- **Problem**: ➕ New Project icon in sidebar was routing to legacy `/edit` page instead of updated `/generate` UI
- **Root Cause**: Multiple routing points were hardcoded to redirect to `/edit` instead of `/generate`
- **Solution**: Updated all New Project routing to use `/generate` endpoint:
  - **NewProjectButton Component**: Changed redirect from `/projects/${projectId}/edit` to `/projects/${projectId}/generate`
  - **GenerateSidebar Collapsed Button**: Reverted to original ➕ icon but updated to use tRPC mutation and route to `/generate`
  - **Direct Route**: Updated `/projects/new` page redirect from `/edit` to `/generate`
- **Technical Changes**:
  - Modified `src/components/client/NewProjectButton.tsx` redirect route
  - Updated `src/app/projects/[id]/generate/workspace/GenerateSidebar.tsx` collapsed sidebar button to use tRPC API with ➕ icon
  - Fixed `src/app/projects/new/page.tsx` redirect destination
- **Result**: All New Project creation flows now correctly route to the updated `/generate` UI with chat panel, video player, and modern workspace interface. Collapsed sidebar maintains original ➕ icon appearance.

**December 19, 2024: Fixed Scene Creation vs. Update Logic & Preserved Scene Naming ✅**
- **Problem**: All prompts were being interpreted as scene updates, even when users intended to create new scenes. Scene names were being overwritten on updates.
- **Root Cause**: Overly aggressive edit detection logic and lack of name preservation in update operations
- **Solution**: Implemented proper scene creation vs. update decision layer:
  - **Explicit New Scene Indicators**: "create", "new scene", "generate", "build", "design" → always create new scenes
  - **Explicit Edit Indicators**: "make it", "change", "modify", "update", "fix", "adjust" → update existing scenes
  - **Context-Aware Logic**: No selected scene = new scene, short messages with selected scene = edit
  - **Scene Name Preservation**: Original scene names are preserved on updates, only generated for new scenes
- **Backend Changes**:
  - Modified `upsertScene()` to only update `tsxCode` and `props` for existing scenes, preserving `name`
  - Added `existingSceneName` tracking in edit mode
  - Updated scene data saving to use preserved names for edits
- **Frontend Changes**:
  - Improved `isLikelyEdit()` function with explicit indicators and better logic
  - Updated completion messages: "Scene generated: [title] ✅" vs "Scene updated ✅"
  - Removed aggressive edit detection that was causing false positives
- **Result**: Users can now reliably create new scenes with "create" prompts and edit existing scenes with modification prompts. Scene names remain stable once created.

**December 19, 2024: Fixed Duplicate Component Name Identifiers ✅**
- **Problem**: Error "Identifier 'Firework' has already been declared" when creating multiple scenes with similar prompts
- **Root Cause**: Scene generation was creating components with identical names (e.g., "Firework", "FireworkScene") causing JavaScript identifier conflicts
- **Solution**: Implemented unique component name generation system:
  - Added `generateUniqueComponentName()` function that extracts meaningful words from prompts
  - Fetches existing component names from database to ensure uniqueness
  - Appends numeric suffixes when needed (e.g., "FireworkScene", "FireworkScene1", "FireworkScene2")
  - Sanitizes names to ensure valid JavaScript identifiers
  - Updates LLM prompts to specify exact component name to use
  - Adds fallback replacement if LLM doesn't follow naming instructions
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Modified `generateSceneCode` endpoint in `src/server/api/routers/generation.ts`
  - Added database query to fetch existing component names before generation
  - Enhanced system prompts to include required component name
  - Added post-processing to ensure generated code uses correct name
  - Updated error fallback cases to use unique names
- **Result**: Each generated scene now has a guaranteed unique component name, eliminating JavaScript identifier conflicts

**December 19, 2024: Scene Generated Message Now Permanently Visible ✅**
- **Removed auto-hide timeout** for "Scene generated ✅" message - it no longer disappears after 3 seconds
- **Permanent chat history** - completion messages now remain visible in chat history until next generation starts
- **Improved user feedback** - users can see a clear record of all successful scene generations
- **Reset only on new generation** - completion status only resets when starting a new scene generation, not automatically
- **Result**: Clear, persistent record of scene generation success in chat history for better user experience

**December 19, 2024: Chat Panel UX Improvements - Auto-Scroll & Scene Generation Feedback ✅**
- **Added auto-scroll functionality** that automatically scrolls to show latest messages when:
  - New user messages are sent
  - System status messages appear
  - Scene generation starts or completes
  - Database messages are loaded
- **Improved scene generation feedback** with clear status progression:
  - "Generating scene..." with loading spinner during generation
  - "Scene generated ✅" with green checkmark when complete
  - Completion message shows for 3 seconds then disappears
- **Enhanced user experience** with smooth scrolling behavior using `scrollTo()` with `behavior: 'smooth'`
- **Added chat container ref** for precise scroll control and better performance
- **Result**: Users always see the latest messages and get clear, real-time feedback on scene generation progress

**December 19, 2024: Video Player Background Changed to White ✅**
- **Updated video player background** from dark gray (`bg-gray-900`) to white (`bg-white`)
- **Modified RemotionPreview component** to include `backgroundColor: 'white'` in Player style
- **Updated PreviewPanelG container** to use white background for consistency
- **Result**: Clean, bright white background for video player that provides better contrast and professional appearance

**December 19, 2024: Preview Panel Renamed to Video Player with Auto-Play ✅**
- **Renamed panel title** from "Preview" to "Video Player" in `PANEL_LABELS_G` and `quickActions`
- **Added auto-play functionality** to Remotion Player component with `autoPlay={true}` prop
- **Enhanced user experience**: Video now automatically starts playing when:
  - New scenes are generated
  - Scenes are updated or modified
  - Panel is refreshed or recompiled
- **Maintains existing features**: Loop, controls, volume, click-to-play, and fullscreen functionality preserved
- **Result**: More intuitive video player behavior that automatically shows generated content without manual play button clicks

**December 19, 2024: Preview Panel Header Consolidated ✅**
- **Removed redundant lower header** from `PreviewPanelG.tsx` that was cluttering the UI
- **Fixed refresh functionality** by adding hidden button with ID `refresh-preview-button-g` that upper header can trigger
- **Consolidated to single header** - only the upper header (matching other panels) is now visible
- **Preserved all functionality** - refresh button in upper header now works correctly
- **Cleaner UI** - Preview panel now has consistent styling with Chat and Code panels
- **Result**: Single, functional header with working refresh button that matches the design system

**December 19, 2024: Storyboard Icon Hidden from Sidebar ✅**
- **Commented out storyboard panel** from sidebar navigation in `GenerateSidebar.tsx`
- **Preserved workspace functionality**: Storyboard panel still works in workspace if added via other means
- **Easy restoration**: Code is commented out rather than deleted for quick restoration
- **Sidebar panels**: Now shows only Chat, Preview, and Code icons
- **Result**: Cleaner sidebar interface while maintaining backend storyboard functionality

**December 19, 2024: Storyboard Panel and Icon Restored ✅**
- **Restored storyboard panel** to sidebar navigation in `GenerateSidebar.tsx`
- **Restored storyboard to workspace** by updating `WorkspaceContentAreaG.tsx`:
  - Added back to `PANEL_COMPONENTS_G` and `PANEL_LABELS_G` objects
  - Added back to `quickActions` array in drop zone
  - Added back to `renderPanelContent` switch statement with correct props
  - Restored `StoryboardPanelG` import and `ListIcon` import
- **Result**: Storyboard panel is now fully functional and visible in the UI again

  - Removed from `quickActions` array in drop zone
  - Removed from `renderPanelContent` switch statement
  - Removed unused `StoryboardPanelG` import and `ListIcon` import
- **Result**: Storyboard panel is now completely hidden from the UI while preserving all other functionality
- **Panels available**: Chat, Preview, and Code panels remain fully functional

**December 19, 2024: Storyboard Panel Changes Completely Reverted ↩️**
- **Full reversion completed** of all storyboard panel modifications after Add Scene button integration failed
- **WorkspaceContentAreaG.tsx**: Removed all storyboard-specific code including PlusIcon import, StoryboardPanelGHandle type, onAddScene prop, refs, handlers, and debugging code
- **StoryboardPanelG.tsx**: Reverted from forwardRef back to regular function component, removed useImperativeHandle, restored original internal header with Add Scene button
- **Current state**: Storyboard panel back to original double-header design with Add Scene button in internal header, no wrapper header integration
- **TypeScript errors**: Confirmed that existing TS errors are pre-existing configuration issues (JSX config, module resolution, missing dependencies) not related to the reverted changes
- **Development server**: Confirmed running properly at localhost:3000 despite TS configuration warnings
