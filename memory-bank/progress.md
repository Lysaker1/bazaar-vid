# Project Progress

## Sprint 3 - Core Video Editing Loop
- ✅ Implemented tRPC chat.sendMessage mutation with OpenAI client
- ✅ Connected ChatInterface to send messages and apply patches
- ✅ Updated PlayerShell to use Zustand state store and display dynamic video
- ✅ Implemented project.getById query to fetch initial project state
- ✅ Created development seed script for testing
- ✅ Added messages table to database schema for chat persistence
- ✅ Implemented Zustand state management for chat messages
- ✅ Added initial message processing for new projects
- ✅ Fixed Remotion integration issues with Tailwind and Shadcn UI
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation for Remotion integration

## What works
- User authentication 
- Project creation and management
- Chat system with database persistence and optimistic UI updates
- JSON Patch generation and application
- Video preview with Remotion Player
- Complete message history persistence and synchronization
- Robust state management via Zustand for video properties and chat history

## Recent fixes include:
- Unified all global styles (Tailwind, Shadcn UI) into `src/styles/globals.css`
- Deleted `src/index.css` and removed all references
- 21stst.dev is not used; removed any related config or docs
- Fixed Remotion Studio compatibility issues by implementing:
  - Isolated Tailwind configuration specifically for Remotion components
  - Browser-compatible UUID generation for Remotion constants
  - Clean separation of concerns between app and Remotion styles
- Created comprehensive Remotion integration documentation suite:
  - Detailed guide for Tailwind v4 and Shadcn UI integration with Remotion
  - App Router integration patterns for Remotion in Next.js
  - Lambda rendering pipeline documentation
  - Scene management architecture and composition patterns
- Added missing database migration for the messages table
- Improved the Chat UI with a better welcome message for new projects
- Fixed loading states to provide a better user experience
- Made database error handling more robust
- Fixed TypeScript error in chat.ts related to safely parsing path parts from JSON Patches
- Enhanced chat history synchronization between database and client state
- Improved error handling for initial message processing during project creation

## What's left to build
- Comprehensive video rendering functionality
- Offline custom component pipeline
- User asset uploads to R2
- More complex scene types and transitions

## Current status
The application now has a fully functional chat system that stores messages in the database while providing immediate feedback through optimistic updates. The chat panel allows users to describe desired video changes, which are then processed by the LLM to generate JSON patches. These patches are applied to the video in real-time, and the conversation history is persisted for future sessions.

We've implemented a robust Zustand state store (`videoState.ts`) that handles:
- Per-project state management of video properties
- Chat message history with optimistic updates
- Synchronization between client-side optimistic messages and database-persisted messages
- Patch application for real-time video updates

Recent fixes and improvements include:
- Added missing database migration for the messages table
- Improved the Chat UI with a better welcome message for new projects
- Fixed loading states to provide a better user experience
- Made database error handling more robust
- Fixed TypeScript error in chat.ts related to safely parsing path parts from JSON Patches
- Enhanced chat history synchronization between database and client state
- Created detailed technical documentation for Remotion integration and architecture patterns
- Resolved Tailwind v4 styling issues in Remotion components
- Added best practices for Next.js App Router integration with Remotion

## Known issues
- Page route params need to be handled correctly (async/await pattern in Next.js 14+)
- Error messages from backend mutations could be more user-friendly
- Type safety for messages can be further improved
- Should display more detailed responses from the LLM instead of generic confirmation
- Error handling could be more user-friendly
