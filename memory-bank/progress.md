# Project Progress

## Sprint 8 Progress - Comprehensive Test Suite Implementation

We've implemented a comprehensive test suite for the Bazaar-Vid project's LLM integration and video generation systems. These tests ensure the reliability and correctness of our core functionality.

### Completed Implementation (Sprint 8 - Test Suites)

1. **LLM Integration Tests**
   - ✅ Created `openaiToolsAPI.test.ts` - Testing proper parsing of function calls from OpenAI's API, handling multiple tool calls, and graceful error handling
   - ✅ Implemented `responseStreaming.test.ts` - Validating performance targets (<150ms initial response, <500ms first content)
   - ✅ Built `dualLLMArchitecture.test.ts` - Testing the intent + code generation pipeline with proper coordination between models
   - ✅ Added `errorRecovery.test.ts` - Implementing retry logic, fallbacks, and graceful degradation
   - ✅ Created `toolDefinitions.test.ts` - Validating that tool definitions match OpenAI requirements
   - ✅ Implemented `contextManagement.test.ts` - Testing conversation context management across requests
   - ✅ Added `generateComponent.test.ts` - Testing the component generation functionality

2. **Video Generation Tests**
   - ✅ Built `compositionRendering.test.tsx` - Testing Remotion composition rendering
   - ✅ Implemented `playerIntegration.test.tsx` - Testing Player component in client context
   - ✅ Created `sceneTransitions.test.tsx` - Testing transitions between different scene types

3. **Test Infrastructure**
   - ✅ Updated `jest.config.ts` with test categorization (LLM, E2E, Performance, UI)
   - ✅ Configured `setEnvVars.ts` with environment variables for testing
   - ✅ Created OpenAI mock implementation in `__mocks__/openai.ts` 
   - ✅ Built `setupTests.ts` with global test utilities and mocks

### Current Test Suite Status

After running the test suite, we have the following status:

- **Passing Tests (3 suites, 25 tests):**
  - `generateComponent.test.ts` - All 10 tests passing
  - `compositionRendering.test.tsx` - All 5 tests passing
  - `responseStreaming.test.ts` - All 10 tests passing

- **Failing Tests (7 suites, 20 tests):**
  - Primary issues include:
    - Missing mock implementations for OpenAI API
    - Module path resolution issues (`~/server/llm/toolProcessor` not found)
    - Mock implementation issues in `playerIntegration.test.tsx` (React reference in mock)
    - Implementation gaps in context management tests

### Next Steps for Testing

1. **Fix Missing Module References**
   - Create or update the server/llm/toolProcessor module or correct import paths
   - Ensure all mocked dependencies are properly implemented

2. **Fix React References in Mocks**
   - Update the Player mock in playerIntegration.test.tsx to properly handle React references
   - Use require() inside the mock functions instead of relying on imported React

3. **Complete Remaining Implementation**
   - Implement missing functionality in the context management system
   - Fix error recovery tests with proper mock implementations

4. **Add More Comprehensive Tests**
   - Add visual regression testing for Remotion scenes
   - Add more performance benchmarks for video rendering

   - Add UI for browsing and reusing previously generated components
   - Create testing infrastructure for generated components


### HIGH Priority - Completed
- 2025-05-02 – Remotion Custom Component Pipeline: Import Post-processing & Type Safety

  - Merges with existing imports and deduplicates symbols for clean output.
  - Fixed TypeScript errors by adding explicit undefined checks when merging imports.
  - All generated code uploaded to R2 is now guaranteed to be ready-to-use, reducing user-facing errors.

### MEDIUM Priority - Remaining
- Create documentation for the custom component system

### MEDIUM Priority - Completed 
- ✅ Implement OpenAI function calling schema for component generation
- ✅ Create TSX code generation prompt for the LLM (using official Remotion prompt)

This implementation preserves existing functionality while extending the system to allow dynamic component generation, greatly expanding the creative possibilities for users.

## What's left to build
- Comprehensive video rendering functionality
- Offline custom component pipeline (Sprint 5)
- LLM-powered custom component generation (Sprint 6)
- User asset uploads to R2
- More complex scene types and transitions

## Current status
The application now has a fully functional chat system that stores messages in the database while providing immediate feedback through optimistic updates. The chat panel allows users to describe desired video changes, which are then processed by the LLM to generate JSON patches. These patches are applied to the video in real-time, and the conversation history is persisted for future sessions.

We're now preparing to implement the custom component generation pipeline (Sprints 5-6), which will allow users to request and generate custom Remotion effects using natural language. The implementation will include a database schema for custom component jobs, a build worker process using esbuild, R2 storage integration, dynamic component loading, and OpenAI function calling for generating TSX code.

We've implemented a robust Zustand state store (`videoState.ts`) that handles:
- Per-project state management of video properties
- Chat message history with optimistic updates
- Synchronization between client-side optimistic messages and database-persisted messages
- Patch application for real-time video updates

Recent fixes and improvements include:
- Added missing database migration for the messages table
- Improved the Chat UI with a better welcome message for new projects
- Fixed loading states to provide a better user experience
- Made database error handling more robust
- Fixed TypeScript error in chat.ts related to safely parsing path parts from JSON Patches
- Enhanced chat history synchronization between database and client state
- Created detailed technical documentation for Remotion integration and architecture patterns
- Resolved Tailwind v4 styling issues in Remotion components
- Added best practices for Next.js App Router integration with Remotion

## Known issues
- Page route params need to be handled correctly (async/await pattern in Next.js 14+)
- Error messages from backend mutations could be more user-friendly
- Should display more detailed responses from the LLM instead of generic confirmation
- Need to completely migrate client code to use streaming chat API instead of legacy procedures
- Front-end needs to be updated to take full advantage of the streaming response types
