## Sprint 13: Animation Design Brief - Broader Integrations & UI

*   **Goal Recap:** To plan and design how to extend the Animation Design Brief (ADB) functionality (from Sprint 12) into the broader application, especially focusing on UI/UX for managing and interacting with ADBs.
*   **What's Done & Working:**
    *   Planning documents (`sprint13.md`, `13.3.md`) exist, outlining potential future features and specific requirements for UI modifications (e.g., `ScenePlanningHistoryPanel.tsx`).
*   **What's In Progress / Known Issues:**
    *   This sprint is fundamentally about design and future planning. No active coding implementation seems to be in progress *for Sprint 13-specific goals* based on current documentation.
*   **What's Still Pending / Next Steps to "Complete" this sprint's (initial) aims:**
    *   **Implement `ScenePlanningHistoryPanel.tsx` modifications** as detailed in `13.3.md`:
        *   Adding UI to display ADBs (JSON formatted) within scene cards.
        *   Adding "Generate/Regenerate Animation Brief" buttons.
        *   Displaying ADB status and metadata.
        *   Integrating with the `animation.ts` tRPC router.
    *   Begin tackling other UI components and integration points outlined in `sprint13.md` (e.g., dedicated ADB editor modal, video state management extensions) as subsequent efforts.
*   **Approximate "Completion" (of initial planned UI work for ADBs):** ~10% (planning done, specific panel UI work pending).

## Sprint 12: Intelligent Animation Design Layer Implementation

*   **Goal Recap:** Implement a system for LLMs to generate structured Animation Design Briefs (ADBs), store them, and use these ADBs to guide the creation of Remotion components.
*   **What's Done & Working:**
    *   **Backend for ADBs:**
        *   Database schema (`animationDesignBriefs` table) and migration complete.
        *   `animationDesigner.service.ts` correctly generates, stores (with status), and retrieves ADBs.
        *   Comprehensive Zod schema for ADBs (`animationDesignBrief.schema.ts`) ensures type safety.
        *   tRPC router (`animation.ts`) for ADB management is functional.
        *   `componentGenerator.service.ts` has an overhauled prompt system to translate ADBs into detailed instructions for the component-generating LLM.
        *   Core chat logic (`chat.ts`) now uses ADBs for component generation and regeneration.
        *   Previous TypeScript errors in `animationDesigner.service.ts` (OpenAI tool params) and `componentGenerator.service.ts` (ADB property access) have been resolved.
*   **What's In Progress / Known Issues:**
    *   **Unit Testing:**
        *   Initial test files exist for services.
        *   **Blockers:**
            *   Ongoing Jest and ES Modules configuration issues.
            *   TypeScript error in `animationDesigner.service.test.ts`: "Cannot find module '~/server/lib/openai/client'" (Jest path alias issue).
            *   `componentGenerator.service.test.ts` tests need to be made more comprehensive with correct DB mocking (currently simplified).
*   **What's Still Pending / Next Steps to "Complete" this sprint's aims:**
    *   **Robust Testing:**
        *   **Fix all testing blockers** (Jest/ESM config, path alias).
        *   Complete comprehensive unit tests for `animationDesigner.service.ts` and `componentGenerator.service.ts`.
        *   Conduct thorough integration testing of the end-to-end ADB and component generation flow.
    *   **UI for ADB Management (Carries over to Sprint 13's scope):**
        *   Develop UI for users to view, and potentially edit/manage, Animation Design Briefs (as planned in Sprint 13 tasks).
    *   **Further Integration:** As per "What's Left" in `12-progress.md`, this includes full integration with the Component Generator, ADB templating, and potentially client-side rendering components using ADBs.
*   **Approximate "Completion":** Backend core ~85-90%. Overall (including UI and full testing) ~50%.

## Sprint 11: Fixing OpenAI Tool Call Streaming

*   **Goal Recap:** Resolve issues related to the streaming of OpenAI tool calls to ensure reliable parsing and execution.
*   **What's Done & Working:**
    *   Refactored stream processing logic (likely in `chatOrchestration.service.ts`).
    *   Improved error logging and debugging for tool call streaming.
    *   Implemented event buffering (details in `sprint11.md`).
    *   Resolved previous failures in tool execution caused by improper streaming data parsing.
*   **What's In Progress / Known Issues:** None explicitly mentioned for Sprint 11 itself.
*   **What's Still Pending / Next Steps to "Complete" this sprint's aims:** Based on documentation, this sprint's objectives appear to have been met.
*   **Approximate "Completion":** ~95-100%.

## Sprint 9: Intelligent Scene Planning & Dynamic Duration System

*   **Goal Recap:** Implement an LLM-based system for dynamic scene planning (count, types, durations) and integrate this with component generation.
*   **What's Done & Working (MVP):**
    *   Core backend logic for the two-step LLM process (`planVideoScenes` tool followed by `generateRemotionComponent` tool) is implemented.
    *   Standardized on "gpt-o4-mini" model.
    *   Dynamic durations, FPS handling, and scene ID propagation are functional.
    *   Component over-run handling (repositioning subsequent scenes) is implemented.
    *   Server-side patch validation for timing integrity.
    *   Basic timeline UI feedback for scene status (timing issues, validity) is present.
*   **What's In Progress / Known Issues:**
    *   The `TODO.md` for Sprint 9 lists many "Remaining Tasks" which are effectively "in progress" conceptually, or at least acknowledged as needing work.
*   **What's Still Pending / Next Steps to "Complete" this sprint's aims (many items from `TODO.md`):**
    *   **UI Enhancements (Medium Priority):**
        *   Scene regeneration button.
        *   UI feedback for actual vs. planned component duration.
        *   Visual progress indicators in the timeline for scene generation.
    *   **Backend Improvements (Lower Priority):**
        *   More detailed error messages and retry mechanisms for scene generation.
        *   Optimization of scene plan generation for specific video types.
    *   **Comprehensive Testing (Marked as ðŸ”„ - ongoing/needed):**
        *   Unit tests (planning validation, metadata handling, patch construction).
        *   Integration tests (end-to-end flow, over-run handling, error recovery).
        *   UI tests (timeline visualization, status indicators, user interaction).
    *   **Documentation (Marked as ðŸ”„ - ongoing/needed):**
        *   API documentation.
        *   User guide.
*   **Approximate "Completion":** Core functionality (MVP) ~75%. Fully polished, tested, documented version ~40-50%.
