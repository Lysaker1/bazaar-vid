# Test Coverage Map

This document will track the test coverage across different parts of the Bazaar-Vid application.

The goal is to visualize which modules, services, features, and components have test coverage and identify areas that require more testing, based on importance and risk.

## Coverage Status (To be populated)

| Area (Module/Service/Feature/Component) | Test Types Covered (Unit, Integration, E2E, LLM, A2A) | Status (Covered, Partially Covered, No Coverage) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Example Service | Unit, Integration | Partially Covered | Need to add more error handling tests. |
| Another Feature | Unit | No Coverage | High priority to add integration tests for key user journeys. |

**Instructions for updating this map:**

*   Identify a specific area of the codebase or functionality.
*   Assess the existing tests related to that area.
*   Determine the types of tests present (Unit, Integration, E2E, LLM, A2A).
*   Assign a status (Covered, Partially Covered, No Coverage) based on the extent of testing.
*   Add notes on specific gaps or plans for improvement.
*   Keep this map updated as new tests are added or modified.
