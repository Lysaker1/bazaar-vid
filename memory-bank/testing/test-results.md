# Test Results and Findings

## 2025-05-14 Tests for Custom Component Integration

### Summary
We created and ran tests for both:
1. JSON patch operations (customComponentIntegration.test.ts)
2. PreviewPanel component (PreviewPanel.test.tsx)

### Test Execution Results

#### ✅ JSON Patch Operations: Successful
The JSON patch integration tests were successfully implemented and are passing:
- All 5 test cases for customComponentIntegration.test.ts pass
- The implementation uses a custom JSON patch application function instead of the fast-json-patch library
- Tests verify adding, updating, removing and adjusting duration for components

#### ⚠️ PreviewPanel Component: Partially Working
The PreviewPanel test is encountering some challenges:
1. **Path with Special Characters**: The `[id]` in the path requires special handling
2. **Mock Implementation Issues**: 
   - The setProject function is not being called as expected
   - The querySelectorAll mocking is challenging due to DOM manipulation in the component
   - Script elements are not correctly being removed/detected in tests

### Key Findings

1. **DOM Manipulation**: PreviewPanel uses direct DOM manipulation to load and unload scripts, which makes testing more complex as this happens outside React's rendering flow.

2. **Component State**: The `useVideoState` Zustand store is difficult to mock correctly. TypeScript errors suggest we need a more robust mocking strategy.

3. **JSON Patch Operations**: These work as expected when using our simplified implementation, though the fast-json-patch library may require further investigation for proper usage in the actual application.

### Next Steps

1. **Improve PreviewPanel Testing**:
   - Consider adding a data-testid to the preview panel div for easier testing
   - Re-evaluate the script loading/unloading strategy to make it more testable
   - Create a more robust mocking strategy for useVideoState

2. **useVideoState Improvements**:
   - Add TypeScript interfaces for better type safety
   - Consider structuring the store for better testability

3. **Component Lifecycle**:
   - Validate that components are properly cleaned up when unmounting
   - Ensure there are no memory leaks from scripts not being removed
