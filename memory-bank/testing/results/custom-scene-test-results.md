# CustomScene Component Test Results

## Test Summary

**Date**: 2025-05-21
**Component**: `CustomScene.tsx`
**Testing Method**: Terminal-based component testing

## Test Process

We successfully tested the `CustomScene` component using the terminal-based testing tools. We used the following command:

```bash
dotenv -e .env.local -- tsx src/scripts/test-components/test-component.ts src/remotion/components/scenes/CustomScene.tsx ./test-results
```

This command:
1. Loaded environment variables from `.env.local`
2. Used tsx to run the test script
3. Specified the CustomScene component as input
4. Set ./test-results as the output destination

## Test Results

The test script completed successfully with the following output:
- Compiled JS file: `./test-results`
- HTML test file: `test-results.html`

The component was successfully compiled with esbuild, demonstrating that the syntax is valid and can be processed by the build system.

## Key Observations

1. **Environment Requirements**: The testing script requires environment variables from `.env.local` to be loaded using `dotenv -e .env.local --` prefix.

2. **Command Syntax**: The script expects positional arguments (input file then output location) rather than named parameters.

3. **Component Dependencies**: The CustomScene component has dependencies like `useRemoteComponent` that need to be properly sanitized and compiled.

## Next Steps

1. **Component Integration Testing**: Test the CustomScene component in the context of DynamicVideo using the Component Test Harness (`/test/component-harness`).

2. **Error Boundary Testing**: Verify the error handling capabilities by intentionally triggering errors.

3. **Performance Testing**: Evaluate the component's performance with various payload sizes and component complexities.
