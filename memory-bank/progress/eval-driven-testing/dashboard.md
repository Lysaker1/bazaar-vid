# Evaluation Dashboard Implementation

## Overview

The evaluation dashboard provides a visual interface for monitoring and analyzing component generation performance metrics. Following the patterns established in the A2A integration test page, the dashboard offers tabbed sections for different metric categories and visualizations using Recharts.

## Features

### 1. Metrics Overview
- **Success Rate**: Displays overall success rate for component generation
- **Average Generation Time**: Shows time taken for end-to-end component generation
- **Test Count**: Tracks number of tests run in the selected period
- **Common Errors**: Identifies the most frequent error types
- **Success Rate Chart**: Visualizes success rate trends over time 

### 2. Category Breakdown
- **Success Rate by Category**: Bar chart comparing performance across animation types
- **Detailed Category Metrics**: Table with success rate, average time, and test count by category
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded badges showing performance thresholds

### 3. Performance Metrics
- **Pipeline Stage Timing**: Visualizes time spent in each component generation stage
- **Performance Comparison**: Shows average vs. p90 timing metrics
- **Percentage Breakdown**: Identifies which stages consume the most time

### 4. Error Analysis
- **Error Distribution**: Charts errors by stage and type
- **Common Error Types**: Lists the most frequent error patterns
- **Recent Failures**: Displays detailed information about recent failed tests

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components
- `/src/app/test/evaluation-dashboard/page.tsx`: Main dashboard page
- `/src/client/components/test-harness/EvaluationDashboard.tsx`: Container component with tabs
- `/src/client/components/test-harness/evaluation/*.tsx`: Individual view components

### Backend Services
- `/src/server/api/routers/evaluation.ts`: tRPC router with metric query endpoints
- `/src/server/services/evaluation/metrics.service.ts`: Service for database operations

### Visualization
- **Charts Library**: Recharts for React-based visualizations
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI for forms, cards, badges, and other UI elements
- **Date Filtering**: Calendar-based date range selection

## Database Integration

The dashboard queries metrics directly from the database tables created for the eval-driven testing framework:
- `component_test_case`: Stores test case definitions
- `component_evaluation_metric`: Records test results and performance data

## Next Steps

1. **Apply Database Migration**
   - Run the Drizzle migration to add the evaluation tables to the production database

2. **Run Test Harness**
   - Execute the test runner to collect initial metrics for visualization

3. **Dashboard Enhancements**
   - Add export functionality for metrics in CSV/JSON format
   - Implement additional chart types for more detailed analysis
   - Add comparison views for before/after performance changes

4. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Schedule regular test runs and dashboard updates
   - Set up alerts for performance regressions
