# LLM Evaluation Framework Progress

## Overview

The LLM Evaluation Framework is designed to comprehensively test and evaluate the performance of different LLM models and prompts within our A2A system. It implements a dual testing strategy:

1. **Mock-based testing** for unit and integration tests
2. **Real LLM calls** for evaluation and comparison testing

## Current Implementation Status

### Metrics Service

- ✅ Basic metrics service implementation (`src/server/services/evaluation/metrics.service.ts`)
- ✅ Initial test suite for metrics evaluation (`src/server/services/evaluation/__tests__/metrics.service.test.ts`)
- ✅ Content quality evaluation metrics
- ✅ Code quality evaluation metrics
- ⏳ Response time and performance metrics
- ⏳ Token usage and cost tracking

### Test Harnesses

- ✅ Basic A2A test harness with mock LLM calls (`src/server/a2a/__tests__/a2a-test-harness.test.ts`)
- ✅ Initial agent registry service tests with mocks
- ⏳ Model comparison test harness
- ⏳ Prompt effectiveness evaluation harness

## Dual Testing Strategy Implementation

### Mock-Based Testing (Complete)

- ✅ OpenAI client mocking pattern established
- ✅ Mock response generation for various agent types
- ✅ Test utility functions for creating mock responses
- ✅ Integration with Jest for automated testing

### Real LLM Evaluation (In Progress)

- ⏳ Environment variable control for running real LLM tests (`RUN_LLM_TESTS`)
- ⏳ Test suite structure for model comparison
- ⏳ Metrics collection for response quality
- ⏳ Performance and cost tracking
- ⏳ Reporting system for results analysis

## Model Comparison Framework

We're developing a framework to compare:

- Different LLM providers (OpenAI vs Claude)
- Various model sizes (o4-mini vs turbo)
- Response quality for different tasks (code generation, ADB creation, scene planning)
- Performance metrics (response time, token usage, cost)

## Next Steps

1. Complete the environment setup for controlled real LLM testing
2. Implement comprehensive metrics collection
3. Create a dashboard for visualizing comparison results
4. Establish baseline performance for current prompts and models
5. Set up automated regression testing for prompt changes
6. Develop a golden test suite for key agent capabilities

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Cost Management**: Real LLM API calls incur costs; need to implement rate limiting and budget controls
- **Testing Consistency**: Need to ensure consistent evaluation between test runs
- **Environment Management**: Must isolate real LLM tests from regular CI/CD pipelines
- **Metrics Standardization**: Need consistent metrics for comparing different models and prompts

## Target Completion

- Basic framework: Sprint 24
- Full implementation: Sprint 25
- Dashboard and reporting: Sprint 26
