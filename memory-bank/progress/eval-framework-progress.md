# Eval-Driven Testing Framework Progress

## 2023-07-XX: Initial Implementation

### Completed
- [x] Designed and implemented the test case generator for diverse animation test cases
- [x] Created A2A test runner with SSE for real-time monitoring
- [x] Implemented performance metrics collector for timing measurements
- [x] Built code quality metrics collector for analyzing generated components
- [x] Designed database schema for storing test cases and metrics 
- [x] Generated Drizzle migration for evaluation tables
- [x] Created metrics service for database operations
- [x] Implemented database integration layer for test runners
- [x] Built comprehensive test harness that ties all components together

### Database Integration
- Successfully added schema tables to track test cases and evaluation metrics
- Created a proper SQL migration using Drizzle Kit (migration 0007)
- Implemented a type-safe Drizzle ORM-based metrics service for data storage and retrieval

### Test Harness
- Created a configurable test harness that supports:
  - Concurrent test execution
  - Comprehensive metrics collection
  - Database storage
  - Report generation
- Added environment variable configuration for flexibility

## Next Steps
- Apply database migration to Neon database
- Run initial test batches to collect baseline metrics
- Develop interactive dashboard for metrics visualization
- Integrate testing into CI/CD pipeline

## Challenges Encountered
- Needed to ensure schema design works well with existing database structure
- Ensured proper typing throughout the system for type safety
- Made sure test harness respects concurrency limits to prevent overwhelming the system
