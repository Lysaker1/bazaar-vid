# Evaluation Metrics Implementation Progress

## 2025-05-16: Framework Establishment

- Created comprehensive evaluation metrics framework for two key systems:
  - Component Generation Pipeline
  - A2A Protocol Implementation
- Defined both quantitative and qualitative metrics for each system
- Established measurement methods, targets, and baselines where known
- Set up structure for continuous evaluation and improvement

## Next Steps

### Immediate (1-2 days)
- [ ] Implement instrumentation for baseline metrics collection in component generation pipeline
- [ ] Add timing instrumentation to all A2A-related code
- [ ] Create initial test harness for component generation with diverse prompts

### Short-term (1 week)
- [ ] Establish initial baseline measurements for all metrics
- [ ] Build automated testing scripts for daily evaluation
- [ ] Set up first version of metrics visualization

### Medium-term (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] Complete automated evaluation suite
- [ ] Integrate metrics into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Begin first targeted improvement cycle based on metrics

## Implementation Notes

The eval-driven approach represents a shift from feature-based development to empirical improvement. This aligns with AI system development best practices where outcomes are often emergent rather than deterministic.

Key principles:
1. Measure before optimizing
2. Establish clear baselines
3. Target improvements incrementally 
4. Document impact of each change

Existing scripts like the component verification tools can be adapted to contribute to these metrics, especially for code quality evaluation.
