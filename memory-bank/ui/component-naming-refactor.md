# Component Naming Refactoring Implementation

## Architecture Overview

The UI architecture involves two primary components with distinct responsibilities:

### ProjectEditorRoot (Formerly InterfaceShell)
- **New Location**: `src/app/projects/[id]/edit/ProjectEditorRoot.tsx`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Project state management
  - API mutations (rename, render)
  - User session handling
  - Top-level layout coordination
  - Timeline mode state management
  - Sidebar integration
  
âœ… **Implementation Status**: Complete

### WorkspaceContentArea (Formerly WorkspacePanels)
- **New Location**: `src/app/projects/[id]/edit/WorkspaceContentArea.tsx`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Drag-and-drop panel functionality
  - Panel content rendering
  - Panel state management
  - Panel layout optimization
  - Integration with ScenePlanningHistoryPanel
  
âœ… **Implementation Status**: Complete

## Implementation Status

### Completed Refactoring

- âœ… **InterfaceShell â†’ ProjectEditorRoot**
  - Component renamed to better reflect its role as the root component of the project editor
  - File renamed from `InterfaceShell.tsx` to `ProjectEditorRoot.tsx`
  - All imports updated in `page.tsx`
  - Component functionality preserved with the same props interface

- âœ… **WorkspacePanels â†’ WorkspaceContentArea**
  - Name selected to emphasize its role in managing the content area of the workspace
  - File renamed from `WorkspacePanels.tsx` to `WorkspaceContentArea.tsx`
  - Component references in ProjectEditorRoot updated
  - TypeScript interfaces for WorkspacePanelsHandle renamed for consistency

### Additional Improvements

- ðŸ”„ Sidebar Component Updates
  - Fixed TypeScript errors related to panel props
  - Added `onAddPanel` callback to trigger panel creation from sidebar
  - Renamed internal variables for consistency (e.g., `collapsed` to `isCollapsed`)

## Implementation Process

Our implementation approach follows these principles:

1. **One component at a time**: Complete each component rename fully before moving to the next
2. **Preserve functionality**: Ensure all existing features continue to work as expected
3. **Update imports systematically**: Scan codebase for references and update them
4. **Update documentation**: Keep this document updated with progress and decisions

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Rename InterfaceShell to ProjectEditorRoot
- [x] Rename WorkspacePanels to WorkspaceContentArea
- [x] Fix Sidebar component TypeScript errors

### Fixed TypeScript errors:
- [x] Properly cast event targets in handleDragLeave for correct element contains check
- [x] Removed unnecessary projectId from CodePanel
- [x] Added comments for ScenePlanningHistoryPanel and ProjectsPanel props
- [x] Updated panel identifiers to use lowercase for consistency

### Enhanced visual components:
- [x] Added an SVG icon to the DropZone empty state
- [x] Improved SortablePanel styling with proper cursor indicators
- [x] Updated panel headers to use the official PANEL_LABELS for better UX

### Improved functionality:
- [x] Enhanced addPanel method with better duplicate detection
- [x] Updated initial panels to start with preview + chat (standard layout)
- [x] Fixed panel type identification in drag and drop operations
- [x] Ensured consistent panel IDs using the panel type

### Integrated with ProjectEditorRoot:
- [x] Confirmed proper forwarding of the WorkspaceContentAreaHandle ref
- [x] Verified Sidebar integration via onAddPanel callback
- [x] Validated TimelineProvider wrapping for context

## Next Steps

1. Delete old files after confirming all imports are updated
2. Review remaining 27+ modified files from the PR
3. Address homepage-related changes 
4. Fix remaining color inconsistencies
5. Test the full application to ensure all integrations work correctly
6. Consider additional UI component refactoring to enhance clarity and maintainability
