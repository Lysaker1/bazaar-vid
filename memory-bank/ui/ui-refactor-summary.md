We've successfully completed a comprehensive UI refactoring of the Bazaar Video Editor, improving both the visual design and user experience while maintaining all functionality. This refactoring focused on better component organization, improved styling consistency, and enhanced user interactions without page reloads.

## Major Improvements

### Visual Design Enhancements
- Improved color contrast throughout the UI for better accessibility
- Enhanced button styling with consistent gray backgrounds for visibility
- Standardized border styles and rounded corners
- Added proper visual feedback for hover and active states
- Adjusted spacing and padding for a cleaner look

### Functional Improvements
- Fixed sidebar navigation to properly use panel integration
- Improved timeline toggling and resizing capabilities
- Enhanced project navigation using client-side routing
- Standardized project creation behavior using consistent components
- Added proper close buttons to all panels including CodePanel

### Code Quality
- Improved component organization with clearer naming
- Enhanced type safety and prop handling
- Better separation of concerns in component architecture
- Preserved all existing functionality while improving the UI

## Files Modified
