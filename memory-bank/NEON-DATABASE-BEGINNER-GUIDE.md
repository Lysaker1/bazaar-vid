# 🔰 Neon Database Beginner Guide

**For**: Complete database beginners  
**Goal**: Safely manage your Bazaar-Vid database without losing data

---

## 🏗️ Your Current Setup (What You Actually Have)

### **Main Database**: AWS US East (Virginia)
- **Production Branch**: Your live website data (34 MB)
- **Development Branch**: Your testing copy (30.67 MB)
- **Connection**: This is what your website uses

### **Secondary Database**: AWS Europe West (London)  
- **Status**: Separate, probably outdated
- **Recommendation**: Ignore this for now

## 🧠 Simple Concepts

### **What is a Database Branch?**
```
Think of it like Microsoft Word:

📄 Original Document (Production)
├── 📝 Draft Copy (Development) 
└── 💾 Backup Copy (Manual backup)

When you edit the draft, the original stays safe!
```

### **What is a Backup?**
```
Like taking a photo of your document before editing:

Today: 📸 Photo of document
Tomorrow: ✏️ Make changes
If something breaks: 🔄 Use photo to restore
```

## 🛡️ Super Simple Safety Process

### **For ANY Database Change:**

#### **Step 1: Work on Development Branch**
```
1. Go to Neon console → Select development branch
2. Make your changes there first
3. Test that everything works
4. Write down exactly what you did
```

#### **Step 2: Create a Backup**
```
1. Go to production branch
2. Create manual backup before changes
3. Name it: backup_YYYYMMDD (e.g., backup_20250105)
```

#### **Step 3: Apply to Production**
```
1. Make the SAME changes on production
2. Test that your website still works
3. Document what you changed
```

## 🔧 Practical Steps for You

### **This Week: Get Your Bearings**

#### **Step 1: Identify Your Current Connection**
```bash
# Check which database your app is using
# Look in your .env.local file:
cat .env.local | grep DATABASE_URL
```

#### **Step 2: Create Your First Manual Backup**
```sql
-- In Neon SQL Editor (Production branch):
CREATE TABLE users_backup_20250105 AS 
SELECT * FROM "bazaar-vid_user";

-- Verify it worked:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users_backup_20250105;
```

#### **Step 3: Test Development Branch**
```sql
-- Switch to Development branch in Neon console
-- Make a small test change:
UPDATE "bazaar-vid_user" SET name = name WHERE id = 'test';

-- This should work without affecting production
```

---

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### **If Something Goes Wrong**
1. **DON'T PANIC** - you have options now
2. **Check if it's on development** - production is safe
3. **If it's on production** - restore from backup:
   ```sql
   -- Replace broken table with backup
   DROP TABLE "bazaar-vid_user";
   ALTER TABLE users_backup_20250105 RENAME TO "bazaar-vid_user";
   ```

### **Before Any Change - Ask Yourself**
- [ ] Am I on the development branch?
- [ ] Did I create a backup?
- [ ] Do I know how to undo this?
- [ ] Have I tested this change?
