# Streaming Animation Progress Indicator

## Overview
The Streaming Animation Progress Indicator displays real-time updates about animation generation progress within a single, shimmering message bubble in the chat panel. This feature provides feedback to users during the often time-consuming process of generating animations.

## Implementation

### Components
1. **ThinkingAnimation.tsx**: The main component that displays a single, shimmering message that updates in-place as new status updates arrive.

2. **ChatPanel.tsx**: Integration point for the ThinkingAnimation component, handling the state management and event processing to update the animation messages.

3. **globals.css**: Contains the CSS animations for the shimmer effect.

### Key Features
- **Single Message Bubble**: Progress updates replace the previous message rather than stacking as individual messages.
- **Shimmer Effect**: A subtle gradient animation traverses the message bubble to indicate ongoing processing.
- **Minimum Display Time**: Each message displays for at least 2 seconds to ensure users can read the content.
- **Error Handling**: Shows error messages with distinct visual cues.
- **Completion Behavior**: The message automatically removes itself after completion.

## How It Works

1. When a user sends a message that triggers animation generation, the system initializes the ThinkingAnimation component with an initial "Processing..." message.

2. As the system processes the animation, it emits `sceneStatus` events during various stages of processing.

3. The ChatPanel component catches these events and adds detailed, contextual messages to an array, such as:
   - "Analyzing requirements for scene 1..."
   - "Creating animation for scene 1..."
   - "Animation for scene 1 complete"

4. The ThinkingAnimation component displays these messages one at a time, ensuring each is shown for at least 2 seconds.

5. When all animation processing completes (or fails), the component displays a final message and eventually removes itself.

## Integration with Chat UI
The ThinkingAnimation component is integrated directly into the assistant's chat bubble to provide contextual progress updates where users are already looking. This replaces the previous approach that produced separate system messages for each update.

## Example Usage
```tsx
<ThinkingAnimation 
  messages={animationMessages} 
  isActive={isAnimating}
  isComplete={animationComplete}
  isError={animationError}
  errorMessage={animationErrorMessage}
/>
```

## Benefits
- **Cleaner Chat Experience**: Single message updates prevent chat clutter from system status messages.
- **Improved User Feedback**: Gives users visual confirmation that work is happening, especially during longer generation tasks.
- **Contextual Progress**: Provides specific information about what stage of the process is currently active.
- **Modern, Polished UI**: The shimmer effect creates a modern, professional feeling similar to other top-tier AI tools.
