# Component Pipeline Status and Fixes

## Overview of Component Status Flow

The custom component pipeline in Bazaar Vid follows these statuses:

1. **queued_for_generation** - Initial status when a component job is created
2. **generating_code** - When code generation with OpenAI is in progress
3. **generated** - After code has been successfully generated
4. **building** - When the component is being built by the build worker
5. **manual_build_retry** - When a manual retry of building has been triggered
6. **complete** - When the component has been successfully built and is ready to use
7. **failed** - When any step in the pipeline has failed

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Stuck Tetris Components (May 15, 2025)

**Problem**: Components were stuck in "generating_code" status due to missing TSX code:
- AnimateVariousTetrominoScene (ID: 69ecccb5-862c-43a7-b5a5-ddd7cf7776f3)
- OnceARowScene (ID: 46a6e2c8-8e1f-408a-b4a8-a131ec82e48a)

**Solution**: 
- Created `fix-tetris-components.js` script that:
  1. Generated valid Tetris-themed fallback code
  2. Created SQL statements to update component status to "building"
  3. Updated TSX code for the components in the database

**Results**:
- Components successfully updated to "building" status
- Build worker can now process these components
- Fixed on May 15, 2025

### 2. Status Transition Bug (Previous fix)

**Problem**: Components were not properly transitioning from "generating_code" to the next pipeline stage

**Solution**:
- Updated `buildWorker.ts` to look for components with "building" or "manual_build_retry" status
- Improved error handling in component generation to ensure proper status updates
- Added fallback mechanisms to handle validation failures

**Results**:
- More reliable status transitions through the component pipeline
- Better error handling prevents components from getting stuck

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

1. **Monitoring**:
   - Implement a dashboard to monitor component statuses across the pipeline
   - Add alerting for components stuck in intermediate states for too long

2. **Prevention**:
   - Add timeouts for components in "generating_code" state
   - Implement automatic retries for failed components

3. **Recovery**:
   - Create a comprehensive recovery toolkit for various failure scenarios
   - Add the ability to manually override component statuses through an admin interface

4. **Documentation**:
   - Maintain this document with newly discovered issues and their solutions
   - Document common failure patterns and their resolutions
