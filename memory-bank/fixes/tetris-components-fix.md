# Fix for Stuck Tetris Components

## Problem
Certain Tetris-themed components in the project were stuck in "generating_code" status, preventing them from progressing through the build pipeline. These components needed to be updated to "building" status and provided with valid TSX code.

## Components Affected
- `AnimateVariousTetrominoScene` (ID: 69ecccb5-862c-43a7-b5a5-ddd7cf7776f3)
- `OnceARowScene` (ID: 46a6e2c8-8e1f-408a-b4a8-a131ec82e48a)

## Solution Approach
1. Created a script `fix-tetris-components.js` that:
   - Generates fallback TSX code for each Tetris component using Remotion's animation libraries
   - Produces SQL statements to update the component status to "building" and insert the generated code
   - Executes the SQL against the database

2. The fallback components provide:
   - Basic Tetris-themed animation elements (blocks, grid, etc.)
   - Standard Remotion animation techniques (interpolate, useCurrentFrame)
   - Valid export structure to ensure proper component loading

## Implementation Details
- Used ES module syntax with proper TypeScript JSDoc annotations
- Generated SQL that updates both the status and tsxCode fields
- Implemented robust error handling for database operations

## Results
The script successfully updated the components to "building" status with valid TSX code. The components will now be picked up by the build worker and proceed through the normal component build pipeline.

## Execution
```bash
node src/scripts/fix-tetris-components.js
```

## Date Fixed
May 15, 2025
