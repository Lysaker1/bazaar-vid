### In Progress
- Resolving issues with Remotion animation code generation from chat prompts
  - System should generate, insert, and add animations to the timeline based on text prompts
  - Current implementation involves:
    - OpenAI API to generate TSX code for Remotion components
    - ESBuild compilation of generated code
    - Worker processing for component jobs
    - Uploading compiled JS to cloud storage (R2)
  - Potential issues being investigated:
    - Component code generation quality/consistency
    - Compilation errors with generated code
    - Integration with timeline and scene planning
- Integration with cloud storage for uploads
- Database schema for file metadata
- Advanced scene and template management

### Planned
- File organization with folders
- Search and filtering
- Batch operations
- Enhanced previews for various file types
